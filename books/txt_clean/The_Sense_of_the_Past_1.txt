SEVEN
The Analogy of City and Soul in Plato’s Republic
In making the first construction of the city, there is an assumption that it should be able to tell us something about in the individual: we look to the larger inscription to help us read the smaller one, 368D. But, as Plato indeed implies, the larger inscription will help with the smaller only if they present the same message. What is Plato’s reason for expecting the same message? Basically, it is that applies to both cities and men, and that it signifies one characteristic: “So the just man will not differ at all from the just city, so far as the character of justice is concerned, but will be like it” 435B). That there should be some kind of analogy between cities and men in respect of their being would seem to be a presupposition of asking the question “what is and expecting one answer to it.
Indeed at 434E Plato says that when we transfer what we have said about the city back to the man, we may find that it does not work out; but the moral will be that we should go back and try again and “perhaps by looking at the two side by side and rubbing them together, we may make justice blaze out, like fire from two sticks. . . .” Plato clearly has a fair confidence that this technique will work: his confidence is in what I shall call the analogy of meaning.
At 435E, however, he takes what is in fact a different tack. Proceeding there to the division of the soul, he seems at first sight to be backing up the “analogy of meaning.” “Are we not absolutely compelled to admit that there are in each one of us the same kinds and characteristics as there are in the city? For how else could they have got there? It would be ridiculous to imagine that among peoples who bear the reputation for being spirited . . . the spirited character in their states does not come from the individual citizens, etc.” This looks as though it means that we call a city, people, etc. “spirited” because most or all of its individual persons can be called “spirited”—and for certain terms, this style of account is very reasonable.
But for such terms (the three examples that Plato gives at 435E correspond, it is worth noting, to the three elements of his analogy), so far from having something that backs up the previous principle of finding a common characteristic in virtue of which both cities and men are called so-and-so, we have something that defeats it. For if we say that “F” is applied to the city just because it is applied to the men, we have already explained how the term can be applied to both cities and men, and to go on from there to look for a similar explanation of how “F” applies to men is at least pointless, since the phenomenon which set off the search for the analogy in the first place, viz. the fact that “F” applies to both cities and men, has already been explained. If, moreover, the rule for applying “F”to cities is taken as itself the common that we were looking for, then we have not just pointlessness but absurdity, since the common will have to be something like “x is F if and only if x has constituent parts which are F, ” which leads to a regress. Thus the argument at 435E, so far from backing up the “analogy of meaning, ” defeats it.
Plato in any case does not seem to think that every term which can be applied to both cities and men obeys the rule of 435E. Thus at 419A ff.(the beginning of Book IV), answering Adeimantus’ objection that the guardians get a thin time of it, Socrates says that a city’s being sublimely happy does not depend on all, most, the leading part, or perhaps any, of its citizens being sublimely happy, just as a statue’s being beautiful does not depend on its parts being severally beautiful. This contradicts the principle of 435E, and certainly contains a truth. Leaving the importantly, and indeed deeply, contentious case of “happy, ” we can certainly agree that a large crowd of sailors is not necessarily a crowd of large sailors, while an angry crowd of sailors, on the other hand, is a crowd of angry sailors. So what Plato has here are two classes of term: one class (“angry, ” “spirited, ” etc.) obeys the rule of 435E, which we may call the whole-part rule; while the other class (“large, ” “well-arranged, ” etc.)does not.
However, Plato does not proceed along the lines of this distinction. Rather, for an indeterminately large class of terms, possibly including , he wants to say both:
(a) A city is F if and only if its men are F;and
(b) The explanation of a city’s being F is the same as that of a man’s being F (the same of Fness applies to both).The combination of these, as we have already seen, could lead to a regress, but Plato avoids this by holding (a) only for the city-man relation, and not for the relation of the man to any further elements—that is to say, he does not take (a) as itself identifying the of Fness. Thus “F” does not occur again in the explanation of what it is for a man to be F: at that stage, it is reduced to something else. Thus the explanation of a man’s being , and the of in general, are alike given us by the formula.
(c) Each of the elements ( ) does its job, which of course implies
(d) rules.
Applying (a) to the particular case of , we get
(e) A city is if and only if its men are;while at the same time, for a city as for a man, we have the requirement that its being consists in (c)’s being true. But what does (c) mean of a city? For like cities, the elements of cities consist of men: and how are the characters of these elements to be explained? Here it seems the whole-part rule must certainly apply—it was, we remember, with reference to these characteristics that Plato introduced us to it. We shall have
(f) An element of the city is logistic, thymoeidic, or epithymetic if and only if its men are.
But the of a city, as of anything else, consists in (c)’s being true. So in order to be a city must have a logistic, a thymoeidic, and an epithymetic element in it. Since it must have an epithymetic element, it must, by (f), have epithymetic men: in fact, it is clear from Plato’s account that it must have a majority of such men, since the low-est class is the largest. So a city must have a majority of epithymetic men. But an epithymetic man—surely—is not a man; if he is not, then the city must have a majority of men who are not , which contradicts (e).
This contradiction is, I believe, powerfully at work under the surface of the Republic. Remaining still at a very formal and schematic level, we get another view of it by asking what follows if we accept (e) and also take the analogy between city and soul as seriously as Plato at some points wants us to. Since the men are , of each man (d) will be true, and ;(no doubt in some rather restricted way) will be at work in each member even of the lowest and epithymetic class. Some minimal exercise of ;would seem to be involved in bringing it about that each man sticks to his own business, which is the most important manifestation of social : though it is very notable that Plato repeatedly uses formulations abstract and impersonal enough to prevent such questions pressing to the front. (A very striking example of this is at the point where is first, after the hunt through the other cardinal virtues, pinned down. At 433C–D we have a reference to the beneficent effects of the of the guardians, but by contrast with this, “that which is in” [. . . ] even slaves, artisans, women, etc., and which makes the city good, is represented not as a characteristic of theirs, but merely as a fact, that each minds his business [, 433D4–5].Clearly, this fact cannot be “in” these people—the question is, what has to be in these people to bring about this fact.)
But now if the epithymetic class has in this way to exercise some , and this helps it to stick to its tasks, recognise the rulers and so forth, and if we read this result back through the analogy to the individual soul, we shall reach the absurd result that the in a just soul harkens to in that soul through itself having an extra little êof its own. Recoiling from this absurdity, we recognize that in the individual soul, the cannot really harken; rather, through training, the desires are weakened and kept in their place by ê, if not through the agency, at least with the cooperation, of . If with this fact in our hand we come back once more across the bridge of the analogy to the city, we shall find not a and logistically cooperative working class, but rather a totally logistic ruling class holding down with the help of a totally thymoeidic military class, a weakened and repressed epithymetic class; a less attractive picture. The use of the analogy, it begins to seem, is to help Plato to have it both ways.
Does Plato intend us to accept the proposition (e), that the citizens of the city are themselves ê The question is not altogether easy. The passage 433–4, from which I have already quoted the most no-table evasion, manages to create the impression that the answer must be “yes” without, so far as I can see, ever actually saying so. An important contributory difficulty here is the point which has been often remarked, that the earlier account of has left with not enough work to do, so that it looks like merely another way of describing the same facts. In the case of , he comes out and says that it is a virtue of all citizens (431E–432A); but the route to this conclusion has several formulations which make even this seem shaky (431B–D, particularly: “the desires in the many and vulgar are mastered by the desires and the wisdom in the few and superior”). The tension is always the same. The use of the analogy is supposed in the upshot to justify the supreme rule of a logistic element in the city, where this element is identified as a class of persons; and it justifies it by reference to the evident superiority of a soul in which the logistic element controls the wayward and chaotic desires. But this will work only if the persons being ruled bear a sufficient resemblance to wayward and chaotic desires—for instance, by being persons themselves controlled by wayward and chaotic desires. And if they are enough like that, the outcome of Plato’s arrangements will be less appealing than first appears.
Suppose, then, we give up the proposition that all or most people in the city are ê; thus we give up the whole-part rule for . We might, at the same time, put in its place something rather weaker than the whole-part rule, which we might call the pre-dominant section rule:
(g) A city is F if and only if the leading, most influential, or predominant citizens are F.
The effect of using (g) with is of course to cancel any implication that the citizenry at large are—it merely gives us something that we knew already, that the guardians are . But the importance of (g) is in no way confined to the case of—it is a rule which Plato appeals to often, and particularly in his discussions of the degenerate forms of city in Book VIII. It is in the light of the predominant section idea that we should read the reiteration of the whole-part idea which introduces those discussions at 544D. If we look at some of the things that Plato says about the degenerate cities, this will lead us back again to the just city, and to the ineliminable tension in Plato’s use of his analogy.
With the degenerate cities, it is clear in general that not all the citizens are of the same character as the city, and there are references to citizens of a different character. The tyrannical city is, not surprisingly, that in which there is most emphasis on the existence of citizens different in character from the tyrant: 577C “the whole, so to speak, and the best element is dishonourably and wretchedly enslaved”; cf. 567A, 568A “the best people hate and flee the tyrant.” In other kinds of city, there may be a minority of citizens of a character inferior to that of the city as a whole: there may be a few men of tyrannical character in cities where the majority is law-abiding (575A); if few, they have little influence, but if there are many, and many others who follow their lead, then they produce a tyrant (575C). We can notice here that even in a tyranny there is a requirement that a substantial and influential section of the citizens should share the character of the city. Again, at 564D we are told that the “drones” are already present in an oligarchy, but in a democracy they become the leading element
The democracy, however, presents a special difficulty. Plato says that the distinguishing mark of a democracy is that it is the state in which one finds men of every (, 557C), and like a garment of many colours it is decorated with every sort of character ibid.).Having said this, it would be impossible for Plato to say that all the citizens were “democratic” men as described at 561D al.—always shifting, without expertise in anything, prepared to indulge any etc. Nor should it be easy for him to say that the majority are such men. Yet this is precisely what he has to say. The “predominant section” rule says that the character of the state is derived from that of the ruling citizens. In the cases where the rulers are few, this will not necessarily imply much about the character of other citizens, for the few may hold their power by force, threats, etc. (as in the case of the tyrannical state, already considered: and cf. 551B, the origin of the oligarchy). Plato says that a democracy will also come into being by threat of force, 557A—but this is merely vis-à-vis the ruling oligarchs. A democracy is a state in which the many rule, and if it gets its character from that of its rulers, then the majority must have a “democratic” character. This, on the face of it, sorts none too well with the claim that the democratic state will particularly tend to contain all sorts of character—the “democratic” character seems in fact to be a special sort of character. Moving between the social and the individual level once more, Plato seems disposed to confound two very different things: a state in which there are various characters among the people, and a state in which most of the people have a various character, that is to say, a very shifting and unsteady character.
These people, moreover, are the same people that constitute the lowest class in the city; so we are led back once more to the question we have already encountered, of how, consistently with Plato’s analogy and his political aims, we are to picture their quiescent state when (in the form of other persons) rules. It may be said that in the difficulties we have found about this, we have merely been pressing the analogy in the wrong place. The essential analogy here might be claimed to be this:just as there is a difference between a man who is controlled by and a man who is controlled by , so there is such a difference between states, and to try to infer the condition of the epithymetic class when it is ruled from its condition when it is not ruled is like trying to infer the condition of a man’s when they are ruled from their condition when they are not. What we are concerned with (it may be said) is the healthy condition of man or city, and relative to that the difference between a good and a bad state of affairs can be adequately—and analogously—explained for each.
Such attempts to ease out the difficulties only serve to draw attention to them. For, first, certain things can be said about the when they are “ruled.” For instance, there is the notable difference between a man who has his under control, so that he does not act on them except where appropriate, but for whom they are nevertheless very active, so that control is the outcome of struggle and inner vigilance; and a man whose has achieved inner peace. That inner peace, again, might be of more than one kind: some might be mildly and harmoniously active, or there may have been some more drastically ascetic achievement—solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant* could apply to inner peace as well. But these differences, read back into the political case, precisely revive the earlier problems. Inner peace is what Plato must want, but that in the political case requires the allegiance of the epithymetic element, and we are back to the question of how we are to picture that being secured. Again, a difference between the barely self-controlled man and the man of inner peace is that the first has some which the latter does not have—if a man has inner peace, then some he will have eliminated or never had. But does the difference between the good city and democracy then lie partly in the emergence in the latter of extra and more violent epithymetic persons? If so, then Plato has to explain why the working class even in the good city has to be thought of as though they were already potentially such persons. If not, we are faced with the original problem once more, of what it was in those potentially violent persons that kept them in their place in the good city.
Let us suppose that it is the inner peace model that Plato has in mind, and that it is achieved through the exercise of , on a modest scale, by the individuals in the working class. (They might have been said to possess some measure of , if that were not inconsistent with the eccentric theory of knowledge which the Republic presents). If their individual helps in keeping the workers in their place, then (as we saw earlier) the analogy is no longer in full working order, since that feature cannot be read back into the soul without absurdity. But let us waive that point, and ask what has to be presupposed to keep even the remnants of the analogy going for Plato’s purposes. It is not enough that in its economic function, the role of the lowest class should bear some analogy to the role of the in individual life. For if we stick merely to the nature of certain roles or functions, no argument will have been produced against the view of Plato’s democratic enemy, that those roles or functions can be combined with the business of ruling. Criticism of Plato often concentrates on his opinion that ruling is a matter of expertise; but he needs more than that opinion to reach his results in the Republic, and has to combine with it a set of views about what characteristics and talents generally co-exist at the level of individual psychology. In that area, he has to believe not only that êcomes in two sizes (as we might say, regular size and king size), but also that the talents and temperament that make good soldiers go with thymoeidic motivations, and the talents and temperament that make good workers go with epithymetic motivations.
Of these, the former looks plausible enough—indeed, soldierly temperament and thymoeidic motivation are perhaps necessarily connected (that is a question we shall come back to). Again, logistic supremacy and fitness to be a guardian are of course for Plato necessarily connected. But how about epithymetic motivation and fitness to be a Not even Plato at his loftiest can have believed that what actually qualified somebody to be a cobbler was the strength of his . The most he can have thought is that the sort of man who made a good cobbler was one who had powerful ; and this is also the least he can think, if he is to keep any of the analogy going and justify the subordinate position of cobblers by reference to their epithymetic disposition. So what we have to believe, it seems, is that cobblers are characteristically men of powerful passions—of more powerful passions, indeed, than soldiers—who nevertheless have enough rational power to recognize the superiority of philosopher kings when there are philosopher kings, but become unmanageably volatile when there are no philosopher kings.
There have been those who thought that the working classes were naturally of powerful and disorderly desires, and had to be kept in their place. There have been those who thought that they were good-hearted and loyal fellows of no great gifts who could recognize their natural superiors and, unless stirred up, keep themselves in their place. There can have been few who have thought both; Plato in the Republic comes close to being such a one, even though we can recognize that his heart, and his fears, lie with the first story. His analogy helps him to combine both stories, in particular by encouraging us to believe in an outcome appropriate to the second story from arrangements motivated by the first.
What about and the military class? Here there is a slightly different kind of tension in the structure. At no point, we must remember, does the structure present a simple contrast of the psychological and the political, for on both sides of that divide we have two sorts of thing:elements, and a whole which is affected by those elements. On the political side we have classes, and a state which is affected by which class is predominant among them (hence the “predominant section rule” we have already looked at); the theory is supposed to yield both an analysis and a typology of states. On the psychological side, we have “parts of the soul, ” and persons in which one “part” or another is dominant; this yields, first, a classification of motives within the individual, and, second, a typology of character. The difficulties we have just been considering, about the epithymetic class, are generated across the political-psychological boundary, in the relations that Plato finds between, on the one hand, the working class and a state dominated by that class, and on the other hand, epithymetic motivation and a character dominated by such motivation. In the case of the , the most interesting difficulty (it seems to me) breaks out earlier, in the relations between the type of motivation that is represented by this “part of the soul, ” and the type of character that is produced by its predominance. Once the type of character is established, the political consequences follow, granted Plato’s general outlook, fairly easily. Indeed, it is just the appropriateness of those consequences that seems to dictate the connection of ideas on the psychological side; whatever may be the case elsewhere in the Republic, here the political end of the analogy is dictating certain features of the psychological end.
I shall not attempt here any general discussion of the divisions of the soul, which, particularly with regard to the distinction between , is a large subject of great independent interest; 1 I shall make only some remarks about .When it first appears, it already has a rather ambivalent role. On the one hand, it seems to be something like anger, and we are told, in distinguishing it from , that it is manifested by children (441A) and animals (441B), and we are reminded of the Homeric figure who reproached his own anger. However, right from the beginning it takes on the colour of something more morally ambitious (as we might put it) than mere anger or rage; the case of Leontius and other examples (439E–440E) take it rather in the direction of noble indignation, and we are told (440E) that rather than class it with , we should rather say that “in the strife [, a significantly political word] of the soul it takes arms on the side of .” If merely represented anger this would indeed be a surprising psychological claim.
The claim is indeed weakened a little at 441A, when it is said that acts as to “if it has not been corrupted [¡«: it can scarcely mean “destroyed”] by bad upbringing.” But the concession is not adequate. For so long as there is any conflict at all—and if there is not, the question does not arise—it clearly is possible for anger to break out, not merely against , but on the side of against ê. What is more interesting than that psychological platitude is the fact that Plato reveals elsewhere that he is perfectly well aware of it, and indeed in a passage where he is defending exactly the same doctrine as in the Republic. In the image of the chariot and the two horses in the Phaedrus, when the black (epithymetic) horse bolts, the white (thymoeidic) horse helps the (logistic) charioteer to bring it to a halt; and when the black horse is finally stopped, it turns on its companion and “abuses it in anger , 254C). Mere anger, Plato’s dramatic realism reveals, can always side with the devil. The thymoeidic element in the soul is from its inception more than mere anger, or indeed any other such motive which there might be good reason on purely psychological grounds to distinguish from (a drive to self-destructive risk-taking, for instance).
It is to be understood, rather, by working backwards from the character which is determined by its dominance, a character which is in turn to be understood in terms of a form of life: the military or competitive form of life which it was a standard thought to contrast with the life of contemplation on the one hand and the life of gain on the other (cf. Aristotle EN I.5.1095b17, with, in particular. Rep. 581C), a contrast embodied in the Pythagorean saying about the three sorts of people that come to the Games (Iamblichus De Vit. Pythag. 58). In this contrast of types of character there is also a political or social thought, of course, and that is why, as I suggested earlier, Plato has great ease in adjusting psychology and politics in the case of : as the passage in question makes explicit (440E–441A, 440D), politics is there at its introduction.’Ehas an independent psychological foundation, and Plato makes a lot of it and of its psychological relations to in the individual, as a type of motivation. With that, I have argued, there are grave obstacles to Plato’s reading back into the city what he needs for his political conclusions, obstacles to some extent concealed by his use of the tripartite analogy.

TWELVE
Aristotle on the Good: A Formal Sketch
This paper attempts a simple formal treatment of Aristotle’s discussion of the good in Nicomachean Ethics I 1–7 (1094 a 1–1098 a 20). Its aim is to distinguish some of the leading concepts used by Aristotle, and to examine some of the logical relations between them; with the particular purpose of establishing what premisses, granted the formal apparatus, are sufficient or necessary for some of the main conclusions supposedly established by Aristotle in this passage.
We shall use first-order predicate calculus with identity and with the modal operator “N” = “it is necessary that”. Variables “x”, “y”, etc., will range over the arts, enquiries, actions, etc. (1094 a 1 seq) which can in the broadest sense be pursued, and which Aristotle regards as the subject matter of his enquiry into the good. We shall use one primitive predicate letter “P”, which will however have two rôles, as standing for a one-place and for a two-place predicate. “Px” is to be interpreted “x is pursued”; “Pxy” is to be interpreted “x is pursued for the sake of y”. In these interpretations, the terms “pursued” and “pursued for the sake of” are intended to cover a number of expressions used by Aristotle, but which, at least in the discussion under consideration, he seems to use interchangeably, such as “aims at”, “is desired for the sake of”, etc. Some further remarks about the interpretation of “P” will follow the next paragraph.
1094 a 1 seq gives us, a little tentatively, a statement which is presupposed throughout the discussion: that everything that is pursued is pursued for the sake of something; we may trivially add that everything pursued for the sake of something is pursued:
We may add further that if x is pursued for the sake of y, y is itself pursued:
The discussion of the architectonic relations in cc. 1, 2 init. make it clear that the relation “Pxy” must be transitive and, for different values of x and y, asymmetrical:
The restriction of asymmetry to non-identical values of x and y in (4) is necessary because, as will be seen, “Pxy” is not irreflexive.
(3) and (4) clearly raise certain questions about the interpretation of “P”. If, as the previous sketch of an interpretation might well suggest, it is a sufficient condition of the truth of “Pa” that a is at some time pursued by somebody, (3) and (4) will almost certainly under interpretation come out false, since it is clearly possible that Pab by somebody at some time, and Pbc by somebody else at some time, without Pac by anyone at any time. Again, it seems that it might well be the case that Pab by someone at some time, and Pba by someone else at any time, or by the same person at a different time. These difficulties, however, lie not so much in the formalization of Aristotle’s discussion by means of the predicate “P”, as in Aristotle’s discussion itself; exactly these questions are bound to arise in any consideration of his very general method of argument. The most effective ways to avoid these difficulties are perhaps: (1) to restrict interpretation of the variables to actions as characterized by certain preferred descriptions—for instance by selecting characterizations of a and b in “Pab” such that it will be obvious how someone can pursue a for the sake of b, which will in general rule out “Pba” for the same characterizations of a and b; (2) to take as interpretation the dispositional pursuit-structure of one fully rational and consistent agent with a settled pattern of desires. “Fully rational” here must include an evaluational element, which is certainly inherent in Aristotle’s treatment; his discussion, for instance, of things which can be pursued for their own sake is confined to things which a sane and rational man would pursue for their own sake. (This accords with his remarks on the requirements for intelligent study of his theory, 1095 b 3 seq.) It will be safe to say that Aristotle supposes all his propositions to hold for the pursuits of a thoroughly consistent phronimos;* some for wider classes of agents; some, being, or supposedly being, logical truths (such as (1) and (2)), for any conceivable agent. The same must hold for the interpretation of “P”.
Granted that something is pursued, (1) and (2) can generate an infinite series of P-statements:
Pa;
Pab, for some b (by (1));
Pb (by (2));
Pbc, for some c (by (1)); etc.
1094 a 20 (whatever else it states) states that such a series cannot be continued indefinitely, for the good reason that the notion of “pursuit for the sake of” would then lack content (“our desire would be empty and vain”). Nor can we stop its infinite prolongation by making it circular, i.e. by introducing some earlier term into the second argument place of some later statement. For suppose such a series
(i) Pab
(ii) Pbc . . .
(n) Pna.
Repeated applications of (3) will give from (ii) . . . (n) : Pba; but this, by (4), is inconsistent with (i). Hence we may infer, as Aristotle infers,
From this, of course, we cannot infer that there is only one x such that Pxx, i.e.:
nor can we infer
for there is nothing in what has gone before to show that we may not have independent chains Pab Pbc . . . Pkk, Pmn Pno . . . Puu, with no common members.
It may be tempting to think that the two statements *(6) and *(7) are equivalent. This is not so, and since *(7), but not *(6), will be of interest in the later argument, it is worthwhile to distinguish them. The following argument will illustrate the issue:
Suppose (i) Paa.
Suppose further that for some d
(ii) (x) [Px Pxd]
Then (iii) Pa (i, by 1)
(iv) Pad (ii, iii)
Thus, it may be thought, from (i) and (iv)
But since the argument applies equally well to any a such that Paa, we shall have derived *(6) from *(7).
The foregoing argument, however, is invalid, since it requires an extra premiss, that if something is pursued for its own sake, it cannot be pursued for the sake of something else as well:
*(8) is rejected by Aristotle, 1097 a 34. If *(8) were accepted, *(6) and *(7) would indeed be equivalent, since (a) the foregoing argument, with the extra premiss, would be valid, so that *(6) could be derived from *(7); (b) *(7) can be derived from *(6) even without the extra premiss, as follows:
(i) Suppose *(6), and (x) Px;
then (ii) there is just one thing, say d, such that Pdd;
but (iii) everything that is pursued is pursued either for its own sake, or for the sake of something pursued for its own sake (by the argument of (5));
(iv) in either case, it is pursued for the sake of d (by (ii));
so (v) there is something for which everything is pursued.
Thus *(6) implies *(7).
Even the addition of *(8), however, would not make either *(6) or *(7) derivable from any of (1)–(5).
The notion contained in *(7), viz. that of something for the sake of which everything is pursued, is important for Aristotle: it is his notion of “the good, or the supreme good” (1094 a 22). We may therefore define:
and the consequent of *(7) may be written
(10) (x) SGx.
Aristotle is not yet in a position to prove (10). It might be suggested that 1094 a 1 seq. shows Aristotle to have derived (10) invalidly from (1); but this is an implausible, as well as uncharitable, interpretation of his intention, since he clearly regards (1) as certain and presupposes it throughout, but (10) is later introduced as uncertain (1097 a 22 seq.). Nor, I think, does the difficult passage 1094 a 18 seq. (the first sentence of c. 2) have to be taken as an attempt to infer (10) from (5) and the considerations that lead up to it. The passage runs:
If, then, there is some end of the things we do, which we desire for its own sake (everything else being desired for the sake of this), and if we do not choose everything for the sake of something else (for at that rate the process would go on to infinity, so that our desire would be empty and vain), clearly this must be the good and the chief good. [tr.Ross]
Here we have two antecedents for the same consequent, each containing a parenthesis. Let the antecedents with their parentheses be signified by ‘A(a)’, and ‘B(b)’. Clearly (b) is offered as a reason for B, and (a) as a specification of the ‘end’ mentioned in A. If now B(b) were offered as a reason for A(a), we should have the invalid inference referred to. However, it is possible to take B, not as a reason for A(a), but as a consequence of it, brought in by Aristotle as suggested by the larger hypothesis A(a), and suggesting in its turn a reason for itself (b); in this case the invalid inference will not be committed. The passage is in any case confusedly expressed, and it is perhaps impossible to say exactly what it means. If so, the former interpretation is certainly not obligatory. Even if it is accepted, however, it is clear that Aristotle lays no great weight on the invalid argument.
We shall return to (10). Meanwhile, it is to be noted that Aristotle believes that there are at least four things pursued for their own sake (pleasure, honour, reason, virtue 1097 b 2, cf. 1096 b 17):
Of any such thing, it is evident that there does not have to be anything else for the sake of which it is pursued, although (*(8) being rejected) there could be. Of any such thing, Aristotle says that it is final (teleion):
1097 a 34 seq. In the same passage, Aristotle goes on to introduce the notions, at first sight surprising, of “more final” (teleioteron) and “most final” (teleiotaton). He gives in fact two applications of the former, the first to things not pursued for their own sake, the second to things that are pursued for their own sake; of these the former seems of little use, and involves the awkward consequence that something can be more final without being final. Omitting this application, his accounts of the two notions may be represented, respectively:
We may infer
consequents)but the restriction to y’s that are TL in the consequent of (ii) can be dropped, the consequent holding for non-TL y’s as well: for, for any non-TL y such that Pxy, there would have to be (by the argument of (5) and by (12)), some TLz such that Pyz; whence by (3), there would be a TL z such that Pxz, contrary to (ii).
We may further infer
i.e. that there is at most one TLT thing. For
suppose (i) TLTa & TLTb & a b;
then (ii) TLRab & TLRba, (by (14));
which is absurd.
We cannot infer, however, that there is at least one TLT thing:
(It is worth noting, in passing, that we could not derive this by adopting the premiss, nowhere offered by Aristotle,
Since the TLR-relation is asymmetrical, as seen in the proof of (16), *(18) would allow us to derive (17) if the TLR-relation were also transitive, but it is not.)
More importantly for Aristotle’s argument, we could not derive (17) from (10), if we independently accepted that. From (9) and (10) we should have
From (ii), by the acceptable principle abesse ad posse valet consequentia, we could infer
(17), however, by (13) and (14), requires
and it is clear that the second conjunct of the consequent of (iv) cannot be provided from (i)–(iii). Moreover, (iv), and hence (17), does not imply (10), since a posse ad esse non valet consequentia. Thus we have the interesting negative result that the existence of an SG thing and of a TLT thing do not imply one another. Nor is this surprising, if one considers the interpretation of “N” in (12)–(14). It is clear that Aristotle regards the necessity and possibility involved in the notions there defined as intensionally connected with the specifications of the things that are final, most final, etc. Thus happiness (eudaimonia), which is said in fact to be most final, is so because it makes no sense, according to Aristotle, to ask of happiness, so specified, for what it is being pursued. This being so, we can see that merely from the fact that a certain thing was that for which everything was done, it would not follow that it had the further intensional property of being TLT; or conversely.
What we can show, however, is that if there is a SG thing, and there is a TLT thing, they must be one and the same:
For suppose (i) SGa
(ii) TLTb
Then, from (i), (ii) (which implies Pb), and (10),
(iv) Pba;
but from (ii), (iii), and (15),
(v) N ~ (Pba).
Aristotle does in fact assert both (10) and (17). What are his reasons? For the latter, two reasons can perhaps be found. The first consists in the mere observation that happiness does possess the intensional characteristic in question, and is in fact pursued. The second is a more a priori reason. It seems to be Aristotle’s belief that a reason or justification can be given or found for a given pursuit only in terms of some end served by the pursuit.1 This end may, of course, lie in the pursuit itself, as has been seen (5). This can be the case with any TL thing. But Aristotle remarks that there is more than one TL thing (11). If we were merely left with the set of TL things as each providing reasons, there could be ultimately reasonless choices between pursuits, since no reason could be given for choosing what conduced to one TL thing rather than what conduced to another. If this is to be avoided, there must be some TL thing that stands in a special relation to the others, as something for which they can be pursued, but not it for them, and this will be the TLT thing.
From neither of these reasons does (10) follow, because it does not follow from the fact that there is one special TL thing for which the others can be pursued that they always are or should be pursued for it. It may be that Aristotle overlooked the lack of implication between (17) and (10), and falsely supposed that an argument for the first was an argument for the second. There is, however, no necessity to think this. For Aristotle gives at least one quite independent argument for (10), viz. the argument from function, 1097 b 25 seq. Moreover, even omitting this as coming rather late in the discussion to be more than a confirming argument, (10) might be supported merely a posteriori (thus 1094 a 1 seq., granted it is not an invalid derivation of (10) from (1), may be the tentative acceptance of an endoxon or received opinion in favour of (10)). If this is so, we may suppose Aristotle to have had independent reasons for believing in an SG thing, and in a TLT thing, and then (validly) have inferred their identity.
We may end by considering one further characterisation that Aristotle applies to the good, viz. that it should be autarkes, or self-sufficient. There are two senses of this term, which, though connected, are distinct, and are sufficiently distinguished by Aristotle at 1097 b 14. In the first sense, the good is autarkes if its possession is to the greatest extent secure, and not subject to the whims of others and similar contingencies not in the possessor’s power. This is the sense that Aristotle also, and better, expresses by saying that the good should be “proper to a man and not easily taken from him” (oikeion ti kai dusaphaireton, 1095 b 25). In the second sense, the autarkes is “that which when isolated makes life desirable and lacking in nothing . . . the most desirable, not counted as one good thing among others” (1097 b 14 seq.). This account at least involves the thought that what is autarkes is a TL thing, and that no other TL thing can be pursued independently of it; for TL things are things pursued for their own sake by reasonable men, i.e. are worth pursuing, and besides the autarkes there is nothing worth pursuing. Thus we can say, as a possible definition:
But by transitivity (3) we can conclude that anything pursued for the sake of any of the things pursued for their own sake is also pursued for the sake of the AUT. Moreover, the AUT is pursued for its own sake; since nothing else is left, we have
The implication, moreover, obviously holds in the opposite direction a fortiori; so, by (9)
In this case, by previous arguments, being AUT will be neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition of being TLT.
However, an alternative definition might be suggested in which “AUT”was expressed in terms of necessity. Thus it might be suggested that anything that satisfied Aristotle’s description of AUT would be something other than which there could not conceivably be anything higher, i.e.
This, however, would not by itself be adequate, since it leaves open the possibility, excluded by the first definition and by Aristotle, that there should be some TL thing independent of, though not superior to, the AUT. Thus what is needed is rather a combination of (20) and *(23). If we allow the principle of inference
this can be economically effected by merely adding “N” to (20):
From this, using (n), we can infer as before (21); but we cannot derive the converse implication to give (22). We can infer the universal closure of *(23) by a simple argument:
Suppose that AUTa and that, contrary to *(23), for some x, say b, such that b ‚ a, Pab. Then, by the argument of (5), there is some y, say c, such that Pcc, and Pac, either directly if c = b, or by transitivity. Then by (24), since Pcc, Pca. But this, by (4), is impossible, since we have Pac.
Moreover, we can clearly derive
from (21), (which we have seen to be derivable from (24)), by the principle ab esse ad posse. Putting together (25) and the universal closure of
*(23), obtained by the last result, we can reach
though the converse implication will not of course hold. Thus if the attractive definition (24) is accepted, we shall have the result that something’s being AUT will imply both its being SG and its being TLT; while, as we have seen before, its being SG neither implies nor is implied by its being TLT; the most that can be established in respect of the two latter concepts alone being that if there is an SG thing and there is a TLT thing, they are one and the same.

EIGHTEEN
Hume on Religion
Hume died on 25 August 1776, and his burial took place four days later. In the words of his biographer, E. C. Mossner: ‘A large crowd had gathered in St. David Street to watch the coffin being carried out. One of the crowd was overheard to remark, “Ah, he was an Atheist.” To which a companion returned: “No matter, he was an honest man.” ’
Both statements, with the slightest of qualifications, seem to have been true. The qualification is to the first statement; if ‘atheist’, is taken to imply, as it often is today, ‘dogmatic atheist’, one who is prepared to assert with certainty that no sort of God or religious principle exists, this Hume was not. However, he fell not very far short of it, and was certainly an atheist by, say, Christian standards: about the non-existence of the Christian God, it seems clear that he felt no doubts. But there was some dimension of religious belief, in some pretty tenuous sense, about which he seems to have remained in a sceptical or agnostic position; and one problem in interpreting Hume on religion is to determine exactly how much or how little he was prepared to regard even as a matter of doubt.
The problem arises in part from the manner in which Hume approaches the subject—in the blend of irony and caution with which he writes about it. The caution was motivated by the religious temper of the times. Even in the liberal-minded Edinburgh of the 1750s and after, there were still certain conventions about the way in which religion, and in particular, of course, Christianity, could properly be discussed, and it was incumbent on those expressing doubts to cover their attacks with some semblance of conformity. Indeed, Hume was persuaded by his friends that his Dialogues concerning Natural Religion—which is his greatest work on religion—could not be prudently published in his lifetime at all; and it is interesting to find him in the last few weeks of his life anxiously making dispositions to ensure that it would in fact be published after his death. In this climate, the irony that was natural to Hume’s temper was of good service in assisting the demands of caution. He employs, as Kemp Smith has pointed out in his invaluable edition of the Dialogues, much the same methods of covering his tracks as did the French sceptic Bayle, from whom Hume learnt a lot. One such method was to claim that one was criticising not Christianity, but superstitious perversions of it; another was to claim that in destroying pretensions to rational argument in support of religious doctrines, one was only making way for Faith, on which they should properly rest. Kant, of course, who was much influenced by Hume’s destructive arguments, was later to claim that this was what he was doing—‘removing Reason to make room for Faith’. The difference is that he meant it, and Hume and Bayle did not.
The irony, however, does not operate only in the direction of caution. For just as in the Treatise, Hume cannot resist expressing himself in a manner designed to upset his conventional readers. It is these two, opposite, uses of irony, I think, one in the direction of prudence and one against it, that have enabled many interpreters in the past to suppose that Hume had more positive religious belief than in fact he did. For it all depends on which side of the irony you take the more seriously.
The central case of these doubts is his Dialogues concerning Natural Religion. This dialogue has three speakers: Demea, an orthodox Christian believer of traditional views, who is prepared to advance an a priori argument for the existence of God; Cleanthes, a more moderate believer, who rests his case on the Argument from Design; and Philo, a sceptic who seeks to subvert the force of both the arguments, and in particular devotes his efforts to refuting the Argument from Design, with which most of the work is concerned. The conversation between these persons is narrated, moreover, by a speaker who says that he agrees with Cleanthes, the moderate believer. This structure has in the past led defenders of Hume’s orthodoxy to suppose that Hume himself rejected Philo’s sceptical arguments: in much the same way, perhaps, as in the Treatise, philosophical doubts about the existence of the material world are rejected as strained and unnatural, as trying to run against the unavoidable force of natural belief. On this interpretation, it is in the person of Philo that Hume speaks ironically, to shock, and in the persons of Cleanthes and the narrator, the moderate orthodox, that he speaks directly.
But this interpretation, it would now generally be agreed, is wrong: the irony is the other way round. Kemp Smith has shown that it is the sceptical views of Philo that most closely express Hume’s own. Indeed, we know from his life that he rejected Christian doctrines. He was brought up in a Calvinist household—not the most narrow and repressive of such households as could be found in Scotland in those times, but rigorous enough. In his late ’teens he worked his way out of these beliefs, and—he explicitly states in a letter—never returned to them, nor to any form of Christianity. When he was dying, indeed, he calmly reaffirmed his disbelief in orthodoxy and the after-life to Boswell, who egregiously took the occasion to exhort him to reconsider his views. In private correspondence, he uses the word ‘Christian’ as a mild term of abuse: he said of Rousseau, when he had too late discovered what Rousseau was like, ‘he has a hankering after the Bible, and is indeed little better than a Christian in a way of his own’; and in 1765 he described the English as ‘relapsing fast into the deepest stupidity, Christianity and ignorance’.Particularly in the earlier years of his adult life, he was strongly anti-clerical, even though later he became friends with various Moderate divines in Edinburgh.
Apart from these biographical evidences, it can be seen from Hume’s theories that he could not have held that sceptical doubts about God’s existence were in the same position as sceptical doubts about, for instance, the existence of the external world. It is of the essence of Hume’s position that those latter doubts run against nature: that one cannot doubt the existence of material bodies, except perhaps for very brief periods in a very unnatural state of mind. But he does not regard the belief in religion as in this sense natural or inevitable at all. He does indeed think that it has natural roots, in the sense that a naturalistic account can be given of why people believe in religion, and this he attempted to give in the work called The Natural History of Religion. But this is a different matter; and it is notable that he did not believe, as did many apologists of his own and later times, that religious belief was a universal phenomenon among mankind.
While it is certain that Hume did not regard religious belief as natural, in his special sense of that term—that is, as something which human nature, by its very constitution, must embrace—there are certain obscurities in his account of it. Here it is best, perhaps, to look first at the theory of The Natural History of Religion. His basic thesis in this work is that polytheism is an earlier belief than monotheism, the latter arising only by a later process. The source of the original polytheism he locates in men’s incomprehension and fear of various circumstances that affect them: because of the unknown and hidden causes of such things as droughts, tempests, sickness and so forth, men are primitively led to posit a collection of independent personal agencies to account for these things. In advancing this view that polytheism was primary, Hume is implicitly criticising thinkers of a Deist temper, as well as some of the orthodox, who supposed that primitive man had already an apprehension of the universe as designed and created by a single designer. On the contrary, this he supposes to be a belief that arises afterwards; roughly, he thinks that one god gets advanced over the others because of emulation in praising and admiring him; and that when he is established as the God, men find reasons, such as the Argument from Design, to prove his existence.
Not only does Hume think that polytheism is primary over monotheism; he also believes—or claims to believe—that it is superior. He has two reasons in particular for this. First, polytheism is more tolerant: the Greeks and Romans, for instance, were always prepared to assimilate other people’s gods. Monotheism, on the other hand, by its very nature tends to intolerance and absolutism. From this greater tolerance of polytheism, Hume is disposed to infer, in general, its greater benevolence; but since he himself mentions the polytheistic Mexicans for the barbarism of their practices, this seems hardly a valid inference. The second reason for the superiority of polytheism is that it does less violence to reason. This is not because it is more reasonable; on the contrary, it is a complete muddle of inconsistent myths and absurd superstitions. The point is that just because it is so, it does not admit of any serious attempt to rationalise it. The trouble with monotheism is that it encourages men to rationalise religion, to try to make a philosophical and theological system out of it, and so long as the religion preserves its dogmas, this can only lead to doing violence to reason itself; one is led into an endless path of pseudo-reasoning, which is worse, because more corrupting and dishonest, than the primitive confusions of polytheism.
Hume is not, of course, recommending polytheism; he thinks that no reasonable and civilised man would dream of accepting it. Here we meet a distinction important to Hume’s account of religion; a fairly commonplace eighteenth-century distinction between the vulgar and the sophisticated. The vulgar perhaps need a religion: if so, polytheism may well be better, as doing less harm. The sophisticated may well do without one: the trouble is that the religion they may be tempted to embrace may be even worse than the primitive one. Here also, and in some ways parallel, is a distinction that Hume makes between superstition and fanaticism. By the first he means an assemblage of mythical beliefs, such as those of polytheism, which may do little harm; by the latter, the proselytising zealotry of religions such as Christianity, which he thinks is straight forwardly pernicious.
Hume has been criticised for his onesided selection of the phenomena of religion. He emphasises over and over again the power of religion to lead men into persecution, unreason, and hatred; he says little, it has been pointed out, on the power of religion to induce love, charity or steadfastness. This is indeed true. But here we have to remember Hume’s moral theory, by which men have a natural tendency to sympathy and benevolence. If then, religious men act benevolently, they do not so act because of religion—they so act because they are men. It is persecution and hatred that need the explanation, and religion only too often provides it. Now this is obviously a very limited and inadequate account of the effects of religious belief—just as, we may add, the story about men’s fears of the unknown is an inadequate account of its origins. In both cases, the limitations lie in the general body of Hume’s philosophy: in the one case, in his moral psychology, in the other, in a limited empiricist theory about the origins of belief. Hume, like Bertrand Russell in our own time, is too amiable and optimistic a man really to understand religion.
I have mentioned Hume’s distinction between the attitudes of the vulgar and of the sophisticated to religion; and I have pointed out that in his view one form of sophisticated religion was worse than the vulgar superstitious sort. Is there then no way in which sophisticated monotheism is superior to other religious beliefs? It would seem from the previous account that there was not. Yet it does seem that there is one sense in which sophisticated monotheism may be nearer in Hume’s view to something which it would be perverse or unwise to deny: he indeed says that the excesses of fanatical monotheism illustrate the maxim, corruptio optimi pessima, the worst of things is the corruption of the best. What, then, is the best? What is this something that may be left over when the bad accretions of religion are stripped away?
To find this, we must look at the Dialogues concerning Natural Religion; and particularly, granted the previous claim that the speeches of Philo represent Hume, at those speeches. Now Sir Leslie Stephen said that the Dialogues was the first sustained philosophical criticism of the Argument from Design. I do not know for certain whether this is true; what is certain is that, in a slightly different sense, it is the last—after it there did not need to be another. Although the Argument from Design lingered on through the nineteenth century, and even to the present time, Hume undermined it in a through-going and definitive manner. The essence of the Argument, as used in Natural Theology—that is, as an argument actually to prove the existence of the Christian God—is that it is a type of empirical argument, an argument from effect to cause. Hume’s objections add up to saying that as such an argument, it does not work. For first, in positing a cause for an observed effect, one is not justified in positing more in the cause than is strictly necessary to produce the effect, and this the Argument does, by positing an infinite, omniscient, etc. being as the cause of what may well be, for all we know, a finite world. Again, the argument assumes that the only cause of organisation, such as we see in the world about us, can be intelligence. But this is quite gratuitous; in our experience we see organisation proceeding from many principles other than intelligence, as for instance, animals from animals and plants from plants; why should we not as well assume the creator of the world to have been some animal or vegetable, rather than a mind? Indeed, the supposition of mind as the first cause is particularly gratuitous, since on every hand we see mind proceeding from matter, but not matter from mind. More generally, there is a fundamental fault in the argument .It is an argument from analogy; but arguments from analogy depend upon repeated occurrences of the instances to which they apply. But in this special case, this condition cannot be satisfied: we only have one world to argue about. Hence any analogy employed must be extremely weak, if it has any strength at all. All this is consistent with Hume’s views on empirical inference, and they are certainly appropriate, for it was in a special application of empirical inference that the argument was supposed to have its strength.
There is a further point. The Argument from Design was supposed to show not merely the existence of a designer, but his benevolence. Here Hume thought that the evidence was not merely too weak to bear the conclusion, but, in some respects, downright opposed to it. While granting the beauty and fitness of final causes in nature, which move our thoughts towards a designer, Philo adds: ‘But there is no view of human life or of the condition of mankind, from which without the greatest violence, we can infer the moral attributes, or learn that infinite benevolence, conjoined with infinite power and infinite wisdom, which we must discover by the eyes of faith alone’. And when Cleanthes replies that no doubt what seems inconvenient and terrible in human life seems so only because of our ignorance of some Divine plan, Philo replies with one of Hume’s most important observations in this connexion: that while such considerations might serve to reconcile the state of man’s life with Divine benevolence, if the latter were independently proved, they certainly cannot assist us to prove this benevolence from the state of man’s life.
Apart from this further application of the criticism of the analogical argument, Hume has in any case an a priori reason for disbelieving in God’s moral attributes. On his moral theory, moral attributes are derived from human nature, and only make sense in relation to it—our ideas of moral goodness are necessarily ideas of human goodness, and could not conceivably be applied to a non-human, infinite being. Indeed, in a letter to Francis Hutcheson, with whose moral theory his own had much in common, he criticises him for inconsistency in supposing that moral attributes could be applied to the Deity.
After all this, little seems to be left of the Argument from Design, or indeed of the Christian conception of God. Hume indeed thinks that the very idea of praying to God, or in the ordinary sense, worshipping him, must be inappropriate, for not only does it involve regarding God as like a man, but as like a not very admirable type of man: ‘To know god’, he makes Philo say, ‘is to worship him. All other worship is indeed absurd, superstitious and even impious.’ But now, what God? Well, Hume throughout the Dialogues is certainly impressed by the existence of the regulated final causes of nature; and he does sum up Philo’s position by allowing him to assent to the ‘somewhat ambiguous, at least undefined proposition, that the cause or causes of order in the universe probably bear some remote analogy to human intelligence’. This is the most that he thinks a reasonable man can assent to; and what is certain is that anything which might be called religion based on this proposition should have no prayer, no worship, no institutions, and no effect on moral conduct. The vague shadow of a possible religious belief is so remote that it could have no effect.
Hume was a sceptic, not a materialist. This was one reason why he objected, as he did, to the dogmatic tone of the French philosophes. For him, the ultimate causes of things remained necessarily mysterious; we know enough, he thought, to know that most things said about God must be false and inappropriate, and we can see further that attempts to argue to his existence must be useless. But we do not know what the ultimate origin of anything is, and cannot—we do not know enough to—exclude the possibility that something rather like an intelligence might—just conceivably—have something to do with it. One suspects that he had another reason for his objections to the philosophes, which was that they got too excited about the non-existence of God. He smelt the odour of a negative fanaticism, and any fanaticism, for Hume, was as bad as any other. Consistently with his philosophy, it would be the human effects of unbelief, as of belief, that would concern him most.
