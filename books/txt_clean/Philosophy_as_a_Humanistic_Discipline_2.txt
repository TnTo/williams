PART TWO
Ethics
SIX
The Primacy of Dispositions
I
There are several ways of understanding a philosophical search for what is primary or fundamental in ethics. The search might be for conceptual priority or dependence; and one way of understanding such a priority would be in terms of definitions. Moore,1 for a while, thought that right was to be defined as productive of the greatest good, and he understood this not as a stipulative definition but as an account of what the term actually meant. This implied that an evidently contentious position, generalized utilitarianism or consequentialism, was to be found not only in language, but on the surface of it. As a linguistic hypothesis, the suggestion was very implausible, and was open to the style of ‘open question’ argument that Moore himself used against suggested definitions of good.
There is a different kind of thought, introducing a different kind of priority, and it may perhaps have been this that Moore unsatisfactorily tried to express in terms of a definition. Such thoughts are concerned with ways in which different kinds of value, in particular the value of different kinds of thing, may be best understood, and they may try to establish priorities between them. They may be called ‘explicative’ thoughts. In the present case, this thought will be to the effect that the value of actions is entirely derived from the value of states of affairs.
There has been a linguistic suggestion also in the opposite direction, to the effect that good is to be defined in terms of right or ought. Here again, as purely linguistic hypotheses the proposals scarcely look plausible. Here again, it is likely that some other thought is being expressed in this form, and it may be an explicative thought. But what will the explicative thought be in this case? In the case of Moore’s proposal, I suggested that the underlying thought might be that actions entirely derived their value from the value of states of affairs. But we cannot simply take the converse path with the present proposal. No one can suggest, with any plausibility at all, that actions alone basically have value, and that the value of everything else is derivative from the value of actions. Action is for some end, and the deliberations that issue in action are usually directed to securing some good other than the action itself. When agents deliberate, they often (though not always) want their eventual action to bring about something else to which they attach value. It cannot be true that the only basic value is that of actions. If there is any interesting explicative view that is misrepresented by the suggestion that good is to be defined in terms of right or ought, it cannot be this.
There is a difficulty in seeing what it might be. Right and ought certainly express notions that apply to actions. If the view says, in any form, that these notions are basic, while notions such as good are derivative from them, it does seem committed to saying that at any rate, all thought about value must in some sense be thought about the value of actions. How can this be, if it is not true—and it obviously is not—that all value derives from the value of actions?
If right or ought expressed some specifically moral notion such as obligation, it does not seem that there could be an answer to this question. Not even all thought about moral value could be reduced to thought about obligation. This is clear if one considers the thought that it would be a morally better state of affairs in which people did what they were obliged to do. People who believe in the basic moral value of obligation are not likely to dispute this thought, but its content cannot be rendered entirely in terms of obligation. In particular, those people need not accept, and will probably reject, a claim to the effect that each of us has an obligation to try to bring about that state of affairs.
However, ought does not have to be explained in terms of obligation. It can lead us to another, and broader, notion: the notion of what one has most reason to do or to promote. Can we explain our thoughts about what is valuable entirely in terms of what we have reason to promote? The answer seems once more to be ‘no’, since we meet the same sort of problem as we met before, that we often think that we have reason to promote some state of affairs because it is valuable.
If there is a way round this difficulty, it will have to lie in going outside the theory of value. We shall have to accept that one can have a reason for promoting something without necessarily thinking that it would be valuable; thus one can have reason to promote something simply because one wants it, without thinking that one’s getting it would be valuable. If we want to explain the idea of the valuable in terms of what one has reason to promote, this is the point from which we shall have to start. We might say, for instance, that a state of affairs is more valuable than another just in case more people have more reason to promote it. Another suggestion, not very different in principle, might be that a valuable state of affairs is one that an agent would have reason to promote who had the power to do so and who acted solely on the basis of what most people had most reason to promote. This might yield a version of utilitarianism, recognizably like Hare’s theory. It is a question for further enquiry, what variations on this structure might be introduced by interpreting more or less generously the idea of what people have reason to promote. But it has to be remembered, of course, that if the structure is to serve the purpose we are presently discussing, of explaining all value in terms of reasons for action, notions of value must not be taken for granted in laying down what are to count as reasons for action.
II
So far I have moved too easily between two different things: dimensions of value, such as rightness, goodness, etc., and the categories of things being valued, such as actions and states of affairs. These two matters are not related to one another straightforwardly. Thus there can be, obviously enough, not only actions that one ought to produce, but good actions; and one can say of states of affairs not only that they are good, but that they ought to come about. So one cannot discuss priorities among the dimensions of value simply in terms of the categories of things being valued. I do not want to deny this. My assumption up to this point has merely been that those who have wanted to make ought or some such notion basic will naturally start from actions, while those who see good as basic will, given this choice, prefer to see the valuation of states of affairs as primary. This seems reasonable enough. Once one leaves behind a preoccupation with definitions, in fact, the more interesting questions are not so much concerned with dimensions of value, as with the categories of items valued, and I shall now concentrate on questions of that type.
A reductive strategy in terms of categories of items valued is going to try to explain the value of everything in terms of the value of as few kinds of items as possible—at the limit, in terms of one kind. If any such monistic view is plausible, it must surely be in favour of states of affairs, because they alone cover enough ground. On the monistic view, then, the most fundamental question of value—I shall call it the value question—is going to be ‘What state of affairs would be best?’
The value question is not itself a practical question. The practical question (as I shall call it), the basic question for agency, must be ‘What shall I do?’ (It cannot be an impersonal question such as ‘What is to be done?’The impersonal question has not been answered as a practical question until the first-personal question has been answered by or on behalf of some agent.2) So we must ask how the practical question and the value question—monism’s one basic value question—are related to one another. Two extreme answers to this have been given, as well as some less extreme ones. One extreme answer is that, on those occasions when action is to be guided by values, the practical question should be immediately guided by the value question (this is the answer of direct utilitarianism). The other extreme answer is that good states of affairs are best promoted if people, in considering the practical question, rarely or never try to answer the value question.
The choice between these answers, or between either of these and other less extreme answers, cannot be principally a philosophical question. Granted the terms of the value question, and given some concrete understanding of what makes states of affairs valuable, it must very largely be an empirical question whether the best states of affairs will come about if agents are generally disposed to ask the value question when deciding what to do. This point is recognized by those who argue for indirect utilitarianism by claiming that it is empirically implausible that the best states of affairs will follow if people try to answer the practical question directly in terms of the value question.
So empirical assessments are needed. In making them, we must take an external view of agents, one that links certain facts about them with the states of affairs that their actions are likely to produce. We shall need to know about the information they are likely to acquire, and their ability to assess consequences accurately, but we shall also have to know about some of their habits or dispositions.
This will not simply be a matter of their inclination or their disinclination to answer the practical question in terms of the value question. We have to consider the alternatives to their answering the practical question in those terms. If they are going to answer the practical question on many occasions without asking the value question, and (as the theorist hopes) their answers are going to issue in actions that lead to the best states of affairs, then those agents must have some other reliable characteristics that explain how these results can come about. If we could rely on the invisible hand, or if, again, we were concerned merely with a system of external rewards and punishments, those characteristics might, in principle, consist in no more than elementary self-interest, some pattern of hopes and fears. But we cannot believe in the first, and our interest is not in the second. We are concerned with an ethical or moral system. If we are to consider any possibility other than that of agents answering the practical question directly in terms of the value question, we shall have to consider other and more determinate characteristics that agents might possess. If agents are to produce desirable states of affairs through the outcome of their deliberations, but the deliberations are not themselves simply couched in those terms, then the agents will need to have ethical dispositions.
There is a well-known instability in structures of this kind. The ethical dispositions are required in order to generate desirable states of affairs, but they cannot remain merely as a black-box mechanism for doing that. They necessarily go beyond that, and provide the agent with a point of view from which the world can be valued. From that point of view, it is typically not merely states of affairs that seem to have value. This extends to the way in which the agent will understand, from that point of view, ethical dispositions themselves. From that point of view, ethical dispositions will seem to have a value that goes beyond their capacity to generate, through action, valuable states of affairs. This instability provides a serious objection to such models. The objection need not take the form of saying that the models are inconsistent. They may rather be socially impracticable. Again, and most interestingly, they may not be impracticable under all possible social conditions. There might be a society, perhaps of an elitist character, that realized the model or an approximation to it. The objection will rather be that the model cannot be realized in a society that satisfies certain requirements of transparency and self-conscious rationality: in particular, it could not be realized in the kind of society that is presupposed by the expectations under which ethical theories of this kind are put forward—expectations of free publication, rational enquiry, open social criticism and so on.
III
We have come to this point by considering ideas of priority in ethics that were expressed first in terms of definitions. That formulation was unsatisfactory; it gave way to the aim of finding one kind of value that might be basic, and explaining others in terms of it. The ‘kinds’ of value involved here could be understood either as dimensions of value (goodness as against rightness, for instance), or in terms of the categories of item valued. Reductive theories may address themselves to either of these matters, or to both, and there is some correspondence between what they are likely to say about the two matters, although the correspondence is not perfect. If one considers reductive theories that address themselves to categories of items valued, the most plausible such theory is that which makes states of affairs the basic item to be valued, and explains other types of valuation in terms of that. But it is a well-known difficulty that it needs only some highly probable contingent hypotheses to make the system that is based on this view very unstable. I believe that those hypotheses are true, that the theory is unstable, and that this is an objection to accepting it.
In fact there are several kinds of thing that we can evaluate in ethical thought, and there is a wide range—wider than I have so far suggested—of concepts in terms of which we can evaluate them. I have suggested that a reduction to states of affairs is not satisfactory. But if there is to be a monistic reduction of the objects of ethical evaluation, this is the most plausible form for it to take. The possibilities are left that there might be some less thorough-going reduction of categories; or that the dimensions of evaluation might be reduced without a reduction of its objects. But the most reasonable conclusion seems to be that attempts at reduction, in either manner, are misguided. Whether one considers the history, the phenomenology, or the social functions of ethical thought, there is no presumption that it will reveal any very general priorities of these kinds, and no reason to suppose that it does.
There are some local priorities. It is true, very roughly speaking, that so far as distributive justice is concerned, the justice of outcomes is prior to the justice that is a disposition of character: you have to explain the latter in terms of the former. With regard to other virtues, there are other things to be said: the relation between courage as a disposition and the courage of courageous acts needs to be explained, and the explanation will not be the same as in the case of justice.4 In such cases there is a presumption in favour of some relation of priority, on the traditional Aristotelian grounds that it is certainly not an accident, a question of a mere homonym, that the same word can apply to actions and to persons, and there should be something illuminating (if not necessarily very simple) to be said about the relations between the different applications of the word. But if we raise some quite general question of priorities among kinds of ethical value, there is no particular reason to expect an answer, and if there is no particular reason, there is no reason. Some actions have value because they lead to valuable states of affairs, some because they express valuable dispositions, some because they are the actions they are, and so on.
This is not to deny that there can be explanations of our ethical conceptions. Some of those explanations are philosophical. Thus it can reasonably be asked why we should have a special kind of ethical reason that we call an ‘obligation’, and the answer to that question will have to start by considering, in a philosophical way and relative to some philosophical assumptions about action and ethical deliberation, what an obligation is. We shall have to consider also what is likely to come about if we have a practice of recognizing obligations as a type of ethical consideration. In some part, those answers will be empirical, if not very demandingly so, and they can contribute to an explanation of this ethical conception. An explanation is indeed needed if our understanding of ethical thought is to be unmysterious (in the best sense, naturalistic).
Since such explanations involve an account of what obligations are, there are other understandings of what obligations are with which they will inevitably conflict. Since they aim to make our ethical consciousness unmysterious, they will particularly conflict with accounts of obligation that make it essentially mysterious. It may be that the pretheoretical understanding of obligation does represent it as rather mysterious (though assuredly not as mysterious as it appears in some theoretical accounts of it). A successful explanation might help us to understand the point and value of living a life in which obligations counted as ethical reasons, but, equally, obligations might not come out of the explanation with quite the resonance they seemed to possess before. Although it is likely that, after we have understood and accepted the explanation, we shall be able to go on living a life in which obligations play some role, some people might feel that this role was not enough, and that obligation had died under the explanatory knife. There are certainly some cases in which the item that is explained does not survive because it does not deserve to survive; the explanation focuses criticism on the item, rather than serving to vindicate it or help us to accept it. Someone who accepted Hume’s celebrated account of ‘the artificial virtue of modesty and chastity’,5 for instance, could scarcely suppose that it left everything where it was (or at least where it was respectably supposed to be).
IV
One’s ideas of what is mysterious or unmysterious, for instance in relation to obligation, will of course be affected by one’s general picture of what ethical convictions are. Explanations of our ethical conceptions must involve explanations of the convictions in which they figure; and that cannot be detached from epistemological issues, since knowledge is itself an explanatory notion. So far as the issues of pluralism are concerned, however, most of what has been said so far should be compatible with a variety of meta-ethical views about the nature and the epistemology of ethical convictions. The pluralism I have recommended does not imply any particular position at that level. Someone who had strongly realist views might, I suppose, have a special motive for asking reductionist questions: they could be a tool helping him or her to find out what kinds of ethical facts there were. But that motivation is not going to alter the phenomena, and the answer to his or her question, if I am right, will have to be that there are several sorts of ethical fact.
While ethical pluralism of this kind does not imply one epistemology rather than another, implications do run in the opposite direction. Our epistemological conclusions will affect our reflective understanding of the pluralism and the range of items involved in it. In particular, they may yield a ground for accepting a certain kind of priority or basicness, one quite different from those already discussed.
Some meta-ethical positions, including those that are, to my mind, the most plausible, have the following consequence: the characteristics that people acquire and exercise in ethical life and which are distinctive of it are not best understood on the model of cognitive or perceptual capacities, but rather on the model of dispositions of character. Let us call any view that has this consequence a disposition view. It is natural to say that disposition views are noncognitivist, but this is too sweeping, if at any rate noncognitivists are committed to holding that there can be no such thing as ethical knowledge. A disposition view can hold that there is some ethical knowledge, but it is knowledge that you come to acquire and exercise only in acquiring certain dispositions of character.6 What is excluded by a disposition view is a realism about ethical facts or properties; I take this to be excluded ex hypothesi, since the only accounts of ethical realism that are at all intelligible try to make one understand the basic ethical capacities as close analogues of sense perception or intellectual intuition.
Granted a disposition view, it follows that dispositions have a certain kind of priority. This is not a priority within ethical thought: it is no more correct than it was before to say that all ethical value is the value of dispositions. What is true, rather, is that all ethical value rests in dispositions. Dispositions are basic because the replication of ethical life lies in the replication of dispositions. They are themselves among the objects of ethical evaluation, and are characteristics in virtue of which people themselves are thought to be better or worse; but, uniquely among those objects, they make the evaluation of all of them possible. In a certain sense, they give the value of those other objects, even though the value of those objects cannot be reduced to theirs.
I have said that these are the dispositions of individuals, and it is as the dispositions of individuals that they are replicated and sustain ethical life. It is of course also true that a form of ethical life is a social thing, and that it involves social institutions, relations and roles. Moreover, there is no reason to suppose that these social items are reducible in any sense to individual terms. Nothing in the disposition view implies that they should be. It is not inconsistent to hold both that ethical life is a social item with much irreducible social content, and that it exists in the form of individuals’ dispositions. The second point concerns the location and realization of the relevant thoughts, desires and attitudes, while the first concerns their content and their explanation.
There are important practical consequences of the disposition view, and of the priority that it accords to dispositions. If ethical life is to be preserved, then these dispositions have to be preserved. But equally, if the ethical life that we have is to be effectively criticized and changed, then it can be so only in ways that can be understood as appropriately modifying the dispositions that we have. Indeed, only a disposition view, it seems to me, can give a socially and psychologically realistic account of ethical criticism and its effects, an account that gives enough weight to the fact that we can actually explain and understand the occurrence of ethical attitudes that we find variously prejudiced, limited, confused, barbarous and so on. Those views, on the other hand, that see the basic ethical characteristics as more like purely cognitive powers need a theory of error, and they do not have one. Without a convincing theory of error, they are bound to find that large-scale ethical criticism is either impossible for them, or doomed to be purely moralistic.

2 I have argued for this in ‘Formal and substantial individualism’, Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, LXXXIV (1984/85).
3 The point that such theories need not be inconsistent is well made by Derek Parfit, Reasons and Persons (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984), who distinguishes various ways in which theories may debar belief, or widespread and whole-hearted belief, in themselves. He is less interested, however, in the social implications of these results, a matter that seems to me fundamental. I have discussed the ideal of transparency and related issues in Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy (London: Collins. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1985), especially at pp. 101 seq.

6 Cf. Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy, op. cit., on the subject of knowledge through ‘thick’ concepts. I have suggested there that the possibility of such knowledge tends to retreat in the face of reflective criticism; but that is, of course, a separate point.
7 It is perhaps worth adding that it is only if objectivism is understood, narrowly, in terms of realism, that a disposition view has to be non-objective. Such a view may quite consistently seek an objective grounding of ethical life by trying to show that a life characterized by some structure of ethical dispositions was the life most worth living.

The Structure of Hare’s Theory
1 I hope that Dick Hare is disposed to accept seriously intended criticism as an expression of interest and respect, since I have expressed in this form my interest in and respect for his work at what he may reasonably regard as excessive length. Trying in a recent book (Williams, 1985)* to describe moral philosophy and some significant modern contributions to it, I found it appropriate to criticize his views at various points of the argument. Here I shall try to examine the structure of his theory as I understand it, and in the course of this I shall make some of these criticisms again, but in a different form, responding to what I take to be the overall shape of his theory. The design of this book** gives him the opportunity to reply and this is the best reason for my repeating some of my points.
2 I take Hare’s theory1 to have a structure that (allowing for some compressed formulations) can be set out in the following way.
(a) Moral language has certain necessary features.
(b) It is necessarily (i) prescriptive and (ii) universal; and (iii) these features are enough to determine the nature of moral thinking at a basic level.
Because of (bi) and (bii),
(c) moral thinking involves identification with everyone’s preferences;2 and because of (biii), this is all there is to basic moral thinking. Hence,
(d) basic moral thinking is equivalent to a quasi-first-personal deliberation, governed by decision-theoretical criteria, over all preferences.
Basic moral thinking, that is to say, is properly represented by what I have called the World Agent model (Williams, 1985:83f.). But,
(e) within the World Agent model, items of different levels can be evaluated: particular actions, type-actions, policies, principles, dispositions, etc. In particular, its criteria can be applied to the activity of this basic moral thinking itself.
When they are so applied, the result is that
(f) everyday moral thinking should not all take the form of basic (‘critical’) moral thought; some of it should involve an ‘intuitive’ expression of dispositions. The result is a two-level theory.
3 I have presented (f) as a consequence of the rest of the theory: immediately, of (e) together with some supposed empirical facts. I think that this is correct in terms of the theory’s logical structure, but it does not adequately reveal the importance of the part played by the two-level view in recommending the earlier parts of the theory. (c) and (d) are not obviously true. Moreover, even if some conception such as that of an impartial consideration of all preferences followed from moral language or, independently of that, was thought to constitute basic moral thinking, it might still be thought that (d), and (c) when taken in a corresponding sense, involved an implausibly strong interpretation of that conception. In face of such objections, the two-level view helps to make (c) and (d) acceptable, by saving the appearances that seemingly tell against them. Various features of moral experience that suggest a different view are conceded their place at the ‘intuitive’ level, while (c) and (d) hold true at the basic or ‘critical’ level.
This is the same strategy as Sidgwick adopted, to try to show that utilitarianism, properly understood, did not have the unpalatable consequences that it seemed to have when advocated as a simple one-level theory. However, the doubts about (c) and (d) have wider effects. The fact that (c) and (d) are not accepted by many careful thinkers makes it not merely unobvious but implausible that they follow from the nature of moral language:3 it casts doubt, that is to say, on the role of (b). If the two-level strategy helps to defend (c) and (d), does it thereby defend the role of (b)? Here there is an interesting contrast between Hare’s position and Sidgwick’s. Sidgwick believed that (c) and (d), or something of the same sort, followed from a purely rational intuition to the effect that there could be no antecedent reason to prefer some one part of attainable good over any other part, and he thought that one came to see this truth by concentrating one’s mind on it. His theory was intended to produce an acceptable balance between very general principles on the one hand and, on the other, spontaneous moral reactions to familiar types of situation. In particular, it was meant to help the theorist in justifying, and in that sense understanding, those reactions in terms of the general principles; it was also to help in defending the principles against the apparently contrary force of the reactions. While the epistemology of intuitions remains incurably obscure, Sidgwick could put this process into some relation to one’s grasp of the basic principles as he conceived of it, by saying that the two-level theory, in giving a place to experiences that seemed to tell against the basic principles, helped to concentrate one’s mind on those principles.
Hare’s use of the two-level theory to make (c) and (d) more acceptable is much like Sidgwick’s. But Hare’s use of it has nothing to do with the way in which he derives (c) and (d) in the first place. The two-level theory does nothing to make more plausible the claim that they follow from the nature of moral language—that is to say, to justify the role of (b). Suppose that it is true that if one thinks hard about (c) and (d), with the help of the two-level theory, one will become convinced of them: that is not enough. It is enough for Sidgwick, but it is not enough for Hare, if he is to justify the role of (b). What needs to be true is that by thinking harder about moral language one will become convinced of them, and the two-level theory offers no help in that.
Besides asking whether considerations about language will yield this result rather than some other, we can ask why something called ‘moral language’ should be expected to reveal anything, or anything reliable, about these matters at all. Language consists in human practices; human beings (as the theory itself insists) have suffered and do suffer from many illusions about the relations of value to the world and so forth; if language can embody or imply any propositions at all about such things, why should it not embody illusions?
Merely as a moral theory, it might seem that Hare’s system could do as well without involving (a) and (b). It could proceed by seeking what Rawls calls ‘reflective equilibrium’, by balancing the general theoretical material against features of moral experience, with the help of the two-level theory. In fact, Hare has strongly resisted this method, for reasons that I shall come back to in 7.
4 The two-level theory has its own difficulties. In what way are ‘critical’ and ‘intuitive’ thinking supposed to be embodied? In Sidgwick’s version of indirect utilitarianism, the two styles of thought correspond to a social distinction between two classes of people, the utilitarian élite and the rest. In that version—‘Government House utilitarianism’, as it may be called—there are clear distinctions between the thoughts of the two classes of people. For one thing, the purely logical or semantic distinction between first-order and second-order thought is mirrored in the fact that the élite thinks about the practices of the others, but the others do not reflect on the special thoughts of the élite—in particular (as Sidgwick makes clear) because they do not know about them. Moreover, the élite are special not merely in the sense that they have second-order thoughts; they also think in a different way about particular practical issues, since more of their thoughts about those issues express direct utilitarianism, and fewer express common-sense principles.
This is not how Hare represents the distinction between the two levels of thought. Elsewhere (Williams, 1985:106–10) I have said that he regards the distinction rather as one between two times, that of practical activity as contrasted with the cool hour of reflection. However, this is not quite right. His distinction is indeed intended as a psychological rather than a social one: it picks out two styles of thought, both of which can be represented in the mind of one person. But it does not merely pick out two times of thought corresponding to those styles, since Hare supposes that a person can think in both styles at one time. Moreover, he believes that there are in this respect various kinds of people, who approximate in different degrees to one or the other of two archetypes, revealingly called the ‘archangel’ and the ‘prole’. The first of these characters uses only critical thinking—which means, his powers are such that he needs no other. The second uses only intuitive thinking, because he is incapable of critical thinking (MT ch. 3, especially 3.1 to 3.3). Thus there are some people—more like the archangel, and more like Sidgwick’s elite—who can think at the critical level more of the time; and this is seen as a valuable capacity, while thinking at the intuitive level is seen rather as a necessity and an imperfection. How much of the time it is advisable to think in one of these styles or in the other is a question that Hare seems to think depends on empirical factors and is of no philosophical interest.
I do not believe that this account is coherent, or that the styles of thought Hare seeks to describe could provide what his theory requires. It is important to make clear what the objection is. It is not an objection (how could it be?) to all styles of reflective or second-order thought, nor to the mere idea that such thoughts might be interwoven with other thoughts in the course of practice. Hare is of course right to say that a general in action can jump between tactical and strategic levels of thought (MT 52). But strategic and tactical thoughts, unless the general is in a muddle, do not conflict, nor is there any conflict between the activities of thinking in the one style or the other. Nor do reflections of moral philosophy necessarily have to conflict with first-order practical thoughts: those of contractualism, for instance, characteristically do not. The objection is specifically to Hare’s kind of theory, which represents the intuitive responses as deeply entrenched, surrounded by strong moral emotions, sufficiently robust to see the agent through situations in which sophisticated reflection might lead him astray, and so on; and yet at the same time explains those responses as a device to secure utilitarian outcomes. The theory ignores the fact that the responses are not merely a black-box mechanism to generate what is probably the best outcome under confusing conditions. Rather, they constitute a way of seeing the situation; and you cannot combine seeing the situation in that way, from the point of view of those dispositions, with seeing it in the archangel’s way, in which all that is important is maximum preference satisfaction, and the dispositions themselves are merely a means towards that.
In saying that you ‘cannot combine’ these two things, I do not mean that as a matter of psychological fact it is impossibly difficult. People indeed have thoughts that they describe in these terms—Hare himself has said that he does. The point is that the thoughts are not stable under reflection; in particular, you cannot think in these terms if at the same time you apply to the process the kind of thorough reflection that this theory itself advocates. That is not a merely psychological claim. It is a philosophical claim, about what is involved in effective and adequate reflection on these particular states of mind.
It might be said that the difficulty arises only because the depth and strength of the ‘intuitive’ dispositions have been exaggerated. If the intuitive responses are seen only as presumptive rules of thumb, then the difficulty disappears, or at least is less severe.4 That is right, but the position it provides is not Hare’s. Moreover, it would not allow Hare to make all the use he does make of the two-level theory. Like Sidgwick, as I said earlier, he uses the theory to save the appearances, explaining people’s ordinary reactions in relation to the basic utilitarian principles. But the more the theory represents the intuitive reactions as merely superficial, provisional, and instrumental, the fewer appearances it saves: it does not explain what people do feel and think, but suggests something else in the same area that they might usefully feel and think.
5 It is important that the two-level theory in its present form is not a unique solution, given the rest of the material, to the problem of what everyday moral thought should be. Its logical status, I suggested earlier, is that it is supported by the basic position together with some empirical material, and if there are difficulties with it, then some other solution may turn out to be better supported. If basic moral thought is defined in archangelic terms, then some standin for it is needed in everyday practice, since full archangelic thought requires an indefinite amount of knowledge and deliberative power (it is all the more exacting because Hare interprets so ambitiously the idea of being impartially concerned with everyone’s preferences). Yet Hare himself cannot see critical, non-intuitive, thought exclusively in archangelic terms, since he thinks that it is something that most of us can conduct some of the time, and when it is seen in that light, it indeed becomes an empirical question, as he claims, to what extent a standin is needed. But then it must also be an empirical question what the standin should be.
It is obvious (as indeed it is from the history of utilitarianism) that there are many candidates for the standin, many styles of everyday moral thought that might in practice produce the best results. Deep dispositions, which Hare favours and which produce their own special problems, are only one. There are rules of thumb, direct utilitarianism applied to a limited constituency of beneficiaries, and others. Proceeding downwards from the account of basic moral thought, and taking the appropriate empirical facts into consideration about the effects in practice of different kinds of moral practice, one might arrive at any of these solutions. The fact that Hare arrives at this particular standin rather than some other may not simply be the product of empirical belief. It may be that he is drawn to this solution because it is at least prima facie better than others at saving the appearances of moral experience. But further argument is needed to show that the position one gets to by proceeding downwards from the top of the system, and the position that best saves the appearances of moral experience, are likely to be one and the same. If the method of reflective equilibrium is adopted, then of course there is a rationale for saving the appearances—that is part of the idea. But if the method is that of travelling down from moral language to basic principles, and from them, in the light of empirical facts, to the most desirable forms of everyday moral thought, there is simply no guarantee that the appearances deserve to be saved.
6 I raised (in 4) a difficulty with the two-level theory in its present form, in which it favours deep dispositions. The difficulty is, in summary, that one could not think at the ‘intuitive’ or everyday level in the way that the theory requires while one was fully conscious of what one was doing: in particular, while one fully understood in terms of the theory itself what one was doing. This is, if real, a difficulty; but why exactly does it constitute an objection to Hare’s theory? Itmight be seen as not yielding an objection, but merely as showing something about the theory, that it cannot work if people, in full reflection and all the time, believe it. Such properties of ethical theories, in particular of utilitarian theories, have been studied by Parfit (Parfit, 1984, Part I),*** who argues that they do not necessarily mean that such theories should be rejected. But this still leaves problems of who is to accept such theories, and in what spirit; and if it is not possible that any, or many, people should accept them, what the status of the theory then is, and the purpose of the theorist in announcing it.
In the case of Government House utilitarianism, the answer to these questions is straightforward. The theory is addressed to the élite, and there is no problem about the élite’s fully believing it, all of the time. The hard problem is a political one, of how to run a modern society that is controlled by such an élite—in particular, running it decently, in accordance with values that the élite might (otherwise) be expected to endorse. Hare’s theory, however, is addressed to people who are expected themselves to have dispositions which they cannot both exercise in the way that the theory requires and at the same time understand in the terms that the theory provides. If they are being asked to attend to this theory, they are also being asked, in some significant degree, to forget it. There could be a theory that asked to be treated in that way, but it is obvious that Hare’s does not. On the contrary this is meant to appeal to and to sustain a spirit of critical reflection and self-enquiry, and Hare makes it clear that he intends his philosophy to contribute to moral improvement through self criticism. It is because the theory has these aspirations that the difficulty is also an objection.
7 Hare in his earliest theory separated his description of moral language from any determination of the content of moral principles. He was also disposed to see that separation as an application of the fact-value distinction—indeed, more than that, as a prime expression of it. Philosophy itself had to be on the ‘fact’ side of the distinction: both because that accorded with a general picture of philosophy as linguistic analysis, and, in particular, because philosophy’s announcement of the fact-value distinction would lack the critical force it was supposed to possess if it were itself an expression of value.
In the later theory which I am considering, the description of moral language, together with empirical information, is thought to determine the content of moral principles; and the degree to which the description of moral language determines the nature of moral thinking, even without empirical information, certainly serves already to eliminate substantive alternatives. (Hare says that what is determined at this level is the form of (basic) moral thought: but then many substantive questions about it must be questions about its form.) Because Hare associated his earlier formulations so closely with the expression of the fact-value distinction, these developments have led some critics to say that Hare has changed his mind about that distinction. However that may be—I think in fact that Hare can answer this claim—the relevant points here are that he has not changed his mind about what philosophy is, and that he has a stronger view now than earlier about its powers.
Hare has always wanted, and earnestly wanted, moral philosophy to have a practical effect, to make a difference. He does not think it an obstacle to this that on his view moral philosophy is, roughly, a branch of philosophical logic. On the contrary: moral philosophy can make a difference only because it has authority, and it can have authority only because of its neutral status as a logical or linguistic subject. He has always held this in some form, but his present theory gives a very special explanation of what this authority is. The crucial belief now is that this neutral subject can yield foundations.
It is this belief that explains his scorn for those who use the method of seeking reflective equilibrium and start their moral philosophy from people’s ‘moral intuitions’. Hare does not primarily object to this, as some utilitarians do, because these intuitions are too conservative; the ‘intuitive’ principles that he puts back at the end of his enquiry tend, in some areas, to be more conservative than those that would have been elicited in the first place. Similarly, the objection cannot simply be that their method is not critical or radical enough, if this is taken in some general sense: in a general sense, some of these philosophers are notably critical or radical. His objection is that, whether conservative or radical in the outcome, the intuitions and the theories elicited from them by these philosophers are mere prejudices: which means, they lack any foundation. This provides one sense in which he does think that these enquiries are not sufficiently critical or radical—the Cartesian sense, that they have not gone back to foundations.
Hare’s present view of moral philosophy and its relation to practice has, then, several strands, with different histories. He now believes:
(i) moral philosophy is (roughly) a logical or linguistic subject;
(ii) it provides foundations;
(iii) it helps us to reflect clearly on our moral thoughts, and in particular—because of (i)—to think about what we mean;
(iv) when we do so, we discover (ii).
Hare has always believed (i). He has not always believed, as he now believes, (ii) and (iv). However, he now believes that in some part the authority of moral philosophy derives from (ii); as we have just seen, his rejection of other methods rests on this.
I earlier discussed the difficulty about the two-level theory and I suggested, in 6, that the reason why that difficulty was an objection to Hare lay in the view that he took of philosophy. In terms of the present schema, it is an objection in virtue of (iii). Hare has always accepted (iii); indeed, before he came to believe (ii), it had to do all the work of explaining why philosophy, as a neutral study of language, had authority and relevance to practical life. (iii) in itself presents no difficulty, at least of this kind. Others may be less inclined than Hare is to stress its purely linguistic aspect, but everyone can recognize it as a worthy declaration of the Socratic impulse, an expression of the values of social and personal transparency. When Hare moved to believing (ii) and (iv), however, it became possible for (iii) to be in conflict with the conclusions of (i). It was bound to be an open question whether the foundations that (i) now yielded were such that the practice recommended by (iii) could be thoroughly carried out. Hare has always assumed that (iii) was an obvious statement of the aims of philosophy, and also that the results of philosophy, as the objective subject described in (i), could be consistently, and no doubt usefully, known by anyone. He now has no assurance that these two things, the external view of what morality is, and the internal representation of it in moral practice, will necessarily fit together.
Some other objections I have mentioned turn on rejecting the idea that a linguistic enquiry will yield foundations. I shall not discuss here the question whether morality should be expected to have foundations, nor the paradox that Hare (and he is not alone in this) should move to a foundationalist view of morality while philosophy has been moving to taking a less foundationalist view of everything else. The present point is only about method. I have already mentioned Hare’s basic reason for thinking that philosophy should not proceed by reflection (in the first place, at least) on our moral ‘intuitions’, opinions, or experiences. His reason is that they are merely ours: as an objection, it rests on his belief in foundations. His particular insistence on a linguistic enquiry, as opposed to such reflections, rests in some part of the general point (i); but the special form taken by his linguistic enquiry reveals that it is itself conditioned by the search for foundations, and by the desire to get away from what is merely ‘ours’.
To those who do not agree with Hare that a linguistic method can yield foundations, he does not provide any purely methodological reason why they should not start from ‘intuitions’—a reason, that is to say, independent of the substantial point on which he and they disagree. They may themselves believe in foundations, but think that the way to find them is by starting from our moral opinions. Or they may not believe in foundations at all, and merely be concerned with the implications, presuppositions, and incoherencies of those opinions. In relation to either of these groups, Hare is in a situation familiar in philosophy (it was Descartes’ own situation), that his objection to their method rests only on what he believes to be the actual results of his own.
Just because Hare’s conclusions govern his method, and his conclusions are so foundationalist, he does clearly answer in his own terms a question that other philosophers often merely ignore. Why should the critical reflection to which moral philosophy is committed be expected to issue in an ethical theory? Hare has a conception of moral philosophy and its aims that naturally issues in such a theory. Those who reject that conception, but still seek a theory to systematize our moral opinions, owe both him and the rest of us an account of why they expect our best understanding of our ethical life to take such a form.

Political Philosophy and the Analytical Tradition
There was a time, not very long ago, when analytical philosophy had more or less given up on political philosophy. The introductions to successive volumes of Politics, Philosophy and Society expressed anxiety about whether the subject could continue to exist, or amazement that it still did; at least one international symposium had as its title “La philosophie politique, existe-t-elle?” and many others had the same theme. There is no need to stress that that time is now past. I do not intend to spend time myself worrying exactly what philosophy is analytical, nor in encouraging discussion on that unrewarding topic, but I take it that for instance A Theory of Justice is in the analytical tradition, as are Nozick’s Anarchy, State, and Utopia and most contributions to Philosophy and Public Affairs. Clearly, the predicted funeral has been indefinitely postponed.
In part, I take the change to be traceable simply to a law—which is so far as I know exceptionless, but not for all that transparent—that living political philosophy arises only in a context of political urgency. The somnolence of political philosophy was to that extent a phenomenon of the period which prematurely saluted the end of ideology. But if so, this already tells us something about political philosophy’s uneasy relation to the analytical tradition. For political philosophy’s habitual, and it seems ineliminable, dependence on the urgency of political questions which are not in the first place philosophical is of a piece with its insistence, when at all interesting, on being both normative and impure. It is normative at least in the sense that first-order moral and political disagreement with the author can relevantly motivate disagreement with his philosophy, and impure in the sense that materials from nonphilosophical sources—an involvement with history or the social sciences, for instance—are likely to play a more than illustrative part in the argument.
Analytical philosophy at that time wanted, and tried hard, to be neither normative nor impure. The distinction of fact and value (or rather, in this sort of case, of theory and value) supposedly served to segregate the philosophical from the normative, while the companion distinction of analytic and synthetic served to segregate the philosophical from the historical or social-scientific. Granted this program, and granted the hereditary characteristics of political philosophy, analytical philosophy was bound not to do much for it. So explanation of the torpor of political philosophy at that time cannot just settle back on the characteristics of the time; it must, further, explain why political philosophy is peculiarly resistant to being made pure and non-normative, and why analytical philosophy at that point had those negative ambitions.
The first question I shall discuss, rather obliquely, below. The second question I shall not try to answer at all, but I will outline what an answer would have to explain. It is often suggested that the negative ambitions of analytical philosophy followed solely from its acceptance, in strong forms, of the two distinctions which I have mentioned, in particular the fact-value distinction. But this must be wrong. For even granted a sharp distinction between fact and value, one has to add a doctrine about the proper role of philosophy in order to determine that philosophy will concern itself with the one but not the other. This point is well illustrated by the work of one of the modern fathers of the fact-value distinction in analytical philosophy, G. E. Moore. Moore, having announced in Principia Ethica (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1903) the existence of the so-called “naturalistic fallacy” and its consequence that no purely logical process could get one from metaphysical propositions to value judgments, was not at all deterred from giving up much of his book to reports of what, in his view, was good. Of course, granted the naturalistic fallacy, these remarks must be in effect additional to his metaphysical and logical claims, but he does not mind making them. He differs from his successors not in views about the relationship of metaphysics or logic to statements of value, but on whether books written by philosophers should confine themselves to metaphysics and logic.
In part this difference can be traced to a difference about the epistemology of value judgments. There might be some reason, if an obscure one, to suppose that if the discovery of what was good rested, as Moore supposed, on the intuition of non-natural properties, then a philosopher would have some appropriate skill of holding relevant intellectual items in transparent suspension in his mind—a skill not peculiar to philosophy but at least favored by it. But once the later developments of fact-value theory led to non-cognitive accounts of the holding of value judgments, then indeed there was a difficulty about the philosopher’s claim, so far as value judgments are concerned, on anyone’s attention. In particular, the tendency to regard value judgments (or rather, their overt utterance) as primarily protreptic, as seeking to exhort or command their hearers, leaves a special darkness about the relation between the philosopher who says such things and his audience.
There has been a real problem about the relation of the modern moral or political philosopher to his audience, of what claim he has on anyone’s attention, and I shall come back to it, briefly, at the end of this paper—though in a context, I hope, less flatly discouraging than that presented by the sort of view I have just mentioned. But in the present connection, it is important that the limitations on analytical philosophy could not possibly have been imposed merely by the fact-value distinction in itself. They required also a special view of the responsibilities of philosophy. It is important, too, that the limitations on philosophy, and the associated drying-up of political philosophy, were not uniquely encouraged by the belief, no doubt important to many “end of ideology” views, that serious value disagreement was at an end and substantial consensus obtained. On the contrary, it was precisely a sense of the contrast between the plurality of values, and their unresolvable conflict, as opposed to the supposed universality of logic and science, that helped to motivate the fact-value distinction.
The fact-value distinction and how to see it in 3-D. I mentioned the question of why political philosophy could not throw off its hereditary involvement with the normative and the impure and form a pure but productive alliance with the chastely limited ambitions of analytical philosophy. The short answer is that the peculiarly two-dimensional operation of the fact-value distinction as then employed offered all it had to offer about ethics or about value in general, and left nothing interesting to be said about the distinctively political issues. The distinction imposed a contrast between those elements of language which registered the state of the world, and those that expressed policies, principles, or decisions to change it—or at any rate, in another version, affective reactions which related to desires to change it. Many of our most interesting value concepts evidently combined both these functions, serving both to register some complex set of facts and to express an evaluation. But the evaluation had to be logically separable from the facts, or a certain way of describing the world would itself import evaluations. Fact would entail value, and, most basically, a certain kind of freedom which this view demands—that an individual’s values should not be dictated to him by the world—would have been abrogated.
If this were right, then it would follow that nothing of a very interesting philosophical character could be said about these complex value concepts. Philosophy would make its general point about the separateness of the value element, and the question of why the descriptive elements should be grouped together, and how the evaluations related to a broader context of beliefs, would be left to the social sciences and thus, by the purity requirement, definitively outside philosophy. From this point of view, the complex value concept cannot invite the question of how those facts involve those values. That presumably would be a philosophical question, were it possible, but from this perspective it is not possible. No fact involves value. We, or other societies, apply values to some facts; and the questions invited by the complex value concept can only be how, and when, and to what facts we or they apply value, and that is seen as a question for the social sciences. But now the distinctive subject matter of political philosophy must certainly involve complex value concepts, for it is not any old right and wrong, but those imported by lawfulness, or justice, or equality, or liberty, which are its concerns. Hence the two-dimensional fact-value theory could find nothing of interest for political philosophy, and it is not an accident that political philosophy should have preserved its old recalcitrance in that respect.
Nor, equally, that it should remain impure. For if there is to be a philosophical way of doing better respect to the complexity of these value concepts and their relations to a wider background, it will not be one which totally leaves behind the interests of the social sciences, but rather one which cooperates with them. I certainly do not want to try to give here any extensive suggestions about the fact-value distinction and what should happen to it. But it is worth mentioning one possibility which curiously did not attract as much interest from fact-value theorists as it might have done: namely that there is no compulsion to use a given value concept at all. Two-dimensional fact-value theory implied that for any mixed concept C it was always possible to have a concept C′ which had all and only the descriptive content of C but lacked its evaluative force; and that it would be a nonphilosophical question whether C′ had a use. But we can take it as itself a philosophical consideration that C could lose both its identity and its point without its evaluative force; and that its identity, further, can be involved in its relations to a wider range of concepts. By emphasizing this consideration, one might hope to recognize that evaluations can be more intimately bound up with ways of describing the world than the earlier analytical account would allow, so that, for instance, the selection of certain kinds of conduct for evaluation itself makes sense only in terms of a general framework of beliefs; and yet one could at the same time preserve the truth that moral beliefs cannot just be a record of what the world is like, and even, with a certain difference, preserve that ultimate value-freedom which the fact-value theorist wanted.
The concept of sin, for instance, relates in itself fact and value, and relates them in a complex way so that they are not merely external to each other—one could not merely have all those beliefs and abandon those values—but, as modern life reveals, there is no necessity for human beings to use the concept of sin. On this way of looking at it, one can regain the three-dimensional sense that it is in the context of a set of beliefs about the world and society that values have a meaning; one can examine the detailed structure of a set of values of this kind without supposing that it is the only possible one; one can approach the value systems of other times and places with a more realistic and flexible set of categories; and one will need to, and be able to, make better use of the social sciences than to regard them as the repository of the nonphilosophical.
It is only with a certain difference that this preserves the requirement of ultimate value-freedom. The idea that one could, so to speak, withdraw one’s value commitment from a complex value term presumably would mean, if it meant anything, that one had a peculiarly individual kind of freedom; butwith the recognition that values are more deeply incorporated in systems of belief, the freedom in question becomes more ultimate and less available, since the reconstruction of an entire outlook has less the appearance of being to hand. The freedom becomes the freedom of man rather than of men. But it was only the extreme abstraction of the earlier view which gave the impression of anything else. It is interesting that the purest exponent of the earlier kind of analytical view I have been discussing, R. M. Hare, has now moved to a much more normative stance, but it is one, of utilitarian type, which precisely preserves the individualism implicit in the earlier view, and, at the same time, the opinion that substantive complex value concepts are in principle redundant or uninteresting.
Reflexive social understanding. It is possible to see that type of element in analytical philosophy as ideological—not, perhaps, in the sense that its propagation serves an interest, but at least in the sense that its direction and presuppositions are formed in ways not evident from its surface, and perhaps not evident to the writers themselves, and which admit of social explanation. I do not want to discuss the question of which, if any, such explanations are true: they tend in fact to wander between the vague and the anecdotal. But I should like to suggest that at any rate analytical philosophy up to now has been notably ill-equipped among philosophies for considering whether such things might be true, for reflexively raising questions of its own relations to social reality. The extreme abstraction I have already referred to, and the conceptual character of its subject matter, not only in an obvious way set it apart from considerations of this kind, but actually logically exclude them. An epistemological reflexion, in purely conceptual terms, on the status of theses of analytical philosophy is of course available and has taken up only too much attention: but reflexion in concrete historical terms was excluded by the ban on the empirical.
Insofar as the purely conceptual stance helps this immunity to social reflexion, one might hope that a greater openness to the impurities of the social sciences might help. Indeed it might, in an obvious and immediate sense, in that much social science at this moment is obsessed with such issues, and some sociology gives the appearance of having collapsed into pure social epistemology. But if, in general terms, one were to believe that the mere presence of the social sciences were to encourage such reflexion, one would clearly be very optimistic, since some branches of the social sciences, in particular some types of political science, are the very subjects which have most emphatically invited complaints of lacking such reflexive self-criticism. It might be said that that criticism would be avoided if the idea of social understanding were joined to philosophy, since philosophy is essentially reflexive. But it is a marriage broker’s optimism to suppose that the mating of reflexive philosophy with the consciousness of social reality gives reflexive social consciousness: as Bernard Shaw said to the actress, “suppose it has your brains and my looks?” To take a particular example, Winch’s theory of the social sciences blends an openness to anthropological data with a philosophical method; indeed it obviously represents an over-close assimilation of social to conceptual understanding. But it is certainly not better blessed with reflexive consciousness than was either analytical philosophy or positivist social science.
There is in fact no mechanical way of ensuring that political and moral philosophers are more sensitive to these issues—as they should be, although the sensitivity should be prepared to take the form, on occasion, of looking the difficulty in the face and passing on (just as one’s recognition of other traditions in philosophy should often take the form of looking them in the face and getting on with something one actually believes in). The lesson I draw from that is that the education of political philosophers should include such epistemological materials as will help them to get some measure of the varying claims of the sociology of knowledge. As it has been said that metaphysicians and philosophers of language should not be verificationists, but should have a verificationist conscience, so political philosophers should have a readiness to be embarrassed by the possibility of reflexion on the formation and direction of their views.
Bit-by-bit or systematic? The question of how systematic philosophy should be, and the related, if not identical, question of how far it should consist of theories, is one that has been the subject of much disagreement within analytical philosophy; with, extremely roughly, a British tradition of piecemeal improvisation (with the conspicuous exception of Russell) being opposed to a theory-directed Teutono-American tradition. The present state of this question largely corresponds to the present political and economic fortunes of these two groupings, and it can hardly be doubted that the more systematic and theory-based approach has, in central areas of philosophy, simply won. In the philosophy of language, notably, the point has established itself that an isolated distinction or analysis lacks both sense and point: Austin’s professed view, that one collects linguistic distinctions like types of beetles, can be seen to be absurd about linguistic distinctions, and not very clever about beetles.
In a theory of meaning such as Davidson’s, as also in Quine’s, the notion of theory itself plays a quite central role: for the notion of meaning is introduced (insofar as it is introduced—the point will do just as well with regard to the surrogates for meaning in these theories) essentially in terms of what conditions are associated with a given expression by the theory which optimally fits all observed utterances. Now what is being referred to here is of course an empirical theory, a theory which a linguist might form about a given language which he was trying to understand, but the point has further ramifications into philosophy itself: for the philosopher will try systematically to give analyses or elucidations of expressions of our own language which will be of a type to fit in, at least, with such an empirical theory, and without some such constraint the choice between possible analyses or elucidations of expressions becomes indeterminate and pointless. This is a strong example, but the same point can be argued to hold more generally; it is only in terms of what could be said about a lot of cases, or expressions, or areas, that the choice of what to say about this case becomes determinate. It is the absence of such constraints that makes a lot of Wittgensteinian philosophy so empty. The original view was that what made the choice of an elucidation or a philosophical remark determinately appropriate was a concern, and what makes a lot of Wittgenstein’s later work impressive is the presence of a recognizable such concern—his own. But many of his followers seem to be addressing postulated or type-concerns, which represent at best only a very weak constraint on what is in fact very inexplicit theory.
The systematic constraints on the philosophy of language hold for other very general areas of philosophy: metaphysics, theory of knowledge, philosophy of mind; in some part, because they do hold for the philosophy of language. Without some such constraints—and I do not want to exaggerate the degree to which they are yet clear or agreed—it is hard to see why one philosophical remark should be more relevant than another, or what might count as an explanation. In this sense, vaguely as I have pointed to it, I should want to claim that philosophy should be systematic. Moral and political philosophy are also parts of philosophy. But it does not follow from that that we should necessarily have systematic moral and political philosophy; or at least, if it does follow, it follows only in the weak sense, which I accept, that these branches of philosophy should be responsive to systematic demands from elsewhere: for one thing, the grammar of moral and political sentences—literal grammar, not Wittgensteinian—is the same as that of other sentences. What does not follow is that moral and political philosophy should have their own systems, or that to supply system should be a primary demand on philosophers in these areas.
The reason is that an important aim, and certain consequence, of systematizing in these areas is to reduce or eliminate conflict among our ideas and sentiments; and before we set out doing that, and while we are doing it, we should reflect on the significance of conflict. Conflict in our moral sentiments and beliefs is, first, a historically, socially, and probably psychologically conditioned phenomenon, the product of such things as pluralistic societies and rapid cultural change as well as, perhaps, more generally distributed psychological needs which tend to conflict. We can, to some extent, understand why we have conflicting sentiments, but that does not mean, or should not mean, that we therefore withdraw our loyalty from them. Second, it is not true that any situation in which there is no such conflict is better than one in which there is, or even—what is perhaps more plausible—that conflict reduction is an aim which always has a very strong priority. In the case of belief-conflict and of explanatory theories, conflict-reduction is an undoubted aim: whether it be for the pragmatist reason, that conflict-elimination itself defines the aim of the explanatory endeavor, or for the realist reason that conflicting beliefs cannot both, in some more substantial sense, be true. But the articulation of our moral sentiments does not necessarily obey these constraints, and to demand that they be schooled by the requirement of system is to alter our moral perception of the world, not just to make it in some incontestable sense more rational.
This is what makes Rawls’ model so misleading, which assimilates moral “intuitions” to the intuitions of a native speaker such as are the input to a linguistic theory. It is not merely that more is involved in schooling the moral responses, in “reflective equilibrium,” to theory than there is in finally writing off some marginal utterances as deviant. It is that the role of theory is different. It is the role of linguistic theory to explain and predict acceptable utterances, and it is the theory for doing that. But in the case of moral sentiments, a Rawlsian theory, that is to say a set of principles or moral notions which unifies our moral opinions and in that sense predicts the reflective reaction to a possible or imaginary case, is not alone in the field: for we can understand equally an external theory, e.g. of social explanation, which predicts that no one set of such principles or notions will do the job. Thus we may have systematically conflicting sentiments, for instance, about the value of character and the value of particular actions and intentions; or of the value of particular, non-moral, sentiments and the value of moral, impersonal sentiments of justice. We can feel the force of both utilitarian and anti-utilitarian arguments. Moreover, we can see perhaps why we have these conflicting sentiments; and if so, we cannot agree that there must be a unified theory which “predicts” the response to various situations, in the Rawlsian way, or else that some of our responses are to be jettisoned.
There are in fact two different points to be made here. First, the mere fact of the possibility of external explanation of value-conflict means that the Rawlsian question parallel to the question in the philosophy of language, “What unified and systematic set of principles will ‘predict’ these reactions?” is a question which need not necessarily have an answer. The unity of a language—even the unity of my language—is given in relation to the explanatory theory itself: whereas the unity of my values or sentiments is not so given, and in relation to the external explanations of how I came by them, they may emerge as not unified. (A man between two cultures is not like an effective speaker of a Creole language.)
The second point is that when these conflicts become clear to a man, there is still a question of to what extent and how he should reduce them. Thus many of us now have two kinds of sentiments about questions of people being killed: utilitarian sentiments on the one hand, and on the other sentiments which have a complex articulation but which involve such notions as that with regard to who is to get killed, no choice is better than choice, and that if a choice has to be made, structural considerations (such as fewer rather than more, the already dying rather than those not already dying, etc.) take precedence. This conjunction of sentiments leads to conflict; and utilitarians in particular (a) argue for a rationalization of our outlook and (b) argue for its rationalization in the utilitarian direction, diagnosing the second set of sentiments as the residue of some earlier non-utilitarian outlook. But there are at least three levels at which this pressure for rationalization can be resisted.
First—and this is one which utilitarians themselves can recognize—the consequences involved in the actual social realization may be more extensive and more harmful than expected. Second, at a psychological level, the rationalized values may be harder to live with and to handle. And third—removed now from utilitarian concerns—it may be the case that these sentiments are metaphysically involved with more of our view of what people are than appears on the surface. That requires exploration, and that exploration requires patience with our apparent irrationalities. And perhaps more than patience—at least, indefinite patience.
It is an open, and I think difficult, question how far it is an unquestionable ideal that even ultimately, moral responses should be harmoniously integrated, in ways in which ours now are for the most part certainly not. (A related, and equally difficult, question is how far an analogous demand holds on first-personal rationality: it is certainly a far from self-evident demand, made by Rawls, Nagel, and many other writers, that one should rationally plan for one’s life as a whole, as though it were a given rectangle to be optimally filled in.) But whatever the answer to those questions, it is certain that such an ideal end is not to be taken as realized in the deep structure of our existing sentiments, nor to be approached by the direct route of setting out to school them in accordance with system. First they have to be understood, which, while it must be done in the context of a systematic philosophy in general, is likely to be a patient and untidy business.
It may be said that morality requires action, and action requires decision—one hopes, on rational principles. It is true that we have to act, but it is only the view that action exhausts the point and content of moral thought that could lead anyone to think that that is the end of this matter. What follow rather are such familiar facts as that sometimes we act, and necessarily act, with less than 100 percent conviction; or again—less familiar, this, than the well-known liberal lack of conviction, and perhaps more invigorating—that it is possible to act with 100 percent conviction on one occasion while quite conscious that on another occasion, only obscurely different from that first one, conviction might not have arrived. The relations between action, conviction, and rationality constitute an area in which moral philosophy, the philosophy of mind, and metaphysics most significantly meet.
But however that may be, politics, it may reasonably be said, is a different matter: for while individual persons can to varying extents go round with conflicting moral sentiments, there is a demand of rational consistency and principle in public positions (quite apart from what is legally enacted). There is obvious truth in this; but among many further things that should be said about it are two which, in terms of a program for political philosophy, qualify its effect. First, the requirement of consistency in principle which obtains on a series of public decisions by an enduring authority in a rational state (idealized as that may be), or on the program of one party (even more idealized though that may be), obviously does not extend to political life as a whole, which precisely can embody not only conflicts of interests, and of straightforwardly opposed principles, but of conflicting values, and of conflicting interpretations of the same values (consider here the conflicts of equality of opportunity with equality of esteem; or of justice as equality with justice as entitlement). The philosopher’s thoughts do not have to be directed to solving these differences; he may do his best work, in fact, in sharpening them, by making it clear in what ways both have a foot in our sentiments. This may not be, in the short term at least, an altogether helpful activity, but it can be a good one.
Second, even insofar as a philosopher’s efforts are directed to assisting rationality in political practice, they may helpfully take the form of providing structures in which it can be recognized how much conflict of value that process can and should absorb. In particular I have in mind here the philosophical study of decision theory, with particular emphasis on structures more complex than the linear, often utilitarian, models, with an emphasis on direct comparability of values, which have often prevailed. It is admitted that actual structures of decision in political bodies lie a long way from these idealizations; but it is also probable that very simple models of what practical rationality is can feed into and affect decision processes. A combination of a mastery of the appropriate formal skills and a steady sense of the existence of genuinely competing and only partially reconcilable goods—something which distinguishes the work of Amartya Sen in this field—is something which political philosophy needs to provide.
History. I am not going to say anything, except by implication, about genuine historical understanding. I suppose, for reasons which are obvious and would be tedious to rehearse, that genuine historical understanding is of the first importance in the understanding of politics and political thought; that diachronic distancing is one very important form of the distancing we need to secure from our own society; and that that gains another importance when the society is an ancestor of our own. Further, it seems to me that to read Plato only as in last week’s Mind is to lose an important part of reading Plato.
About what genuine historical understanding of a text is, understanding of what it meant, I agree with Quentin Skinner that if it is recoverable at all, it must be in the kind of terms which he has detailed, of those contemporary expectations in terms of which a communicative intention could be realized. Moreover, it is clear beyond doubt that the fundamental sense of the question, asked of a historical text, “What does it mean?” is “What did it mean?”
However, there is another sort of question, which can be expressed in such forms as “What does it mean to me?” or “What do I get out of it?” This question, I would rather say, is not so much asked of the text, as asked about it; and that is asked about a book, a set of words, which maximally resemble the words written in the past. These questions, and the answers we give to them, seem to me only rather loosely connected with history, in the sense of the past which gave rise to the book, but they have quite a lot to do with the history of the book—in particular, the more interesting among these questions may continue that history. The book’s Nachleben is not only itself studied, it is lived.
When we treat these books in this way, and for instance represent arguments in them in our own terms, supply modern questions which are like what we take these questions to be, and so on, we are doing something which is indeed conventionally called “history of philosophy,” but is really a sort of philosophy—we might call it “history-of-philosophy philosophy.” In particular, we should beware of two misleading impressions that may be created by calling it “history of philosophy.” One is that the pursuit of the maximally consistent interpretation—a basic rule of this kind of exercise—is a genuine principle of historical reconstruction. We may think it is, for instance, because of its resemblance to a type of principle that plays a genuine role in the sort of linguistic theory I discussed earlier: the principle of charity, by which one interprets an alien language so that what should be evidently true to native speakers comes out as true, and they don’t simply contradict themselves. But that principle, at that level of generality, plays a different role: it is not just a contingent assumption, for we have no independent control over the idea that in general they might be evidently mistaken or contradicting themselves (really). In the case of a particular author and a particular text, however, there is in principle more control over this idea, and some conclusions about it can even be reached a priori. Thus people spend enormous time (I have spent some myself) on trying to find interpretations of Plato’s Sophist which make Plato’s theories consistent. But if Plato’s Sophist is about what we think it is about (and granted his theories about these very difficult subjects came when they did) it is wildly improbable that his theories on those subjects would succeed in being consistent. Of course, the rejection of the principle of consistent interpretation leaves the whole question in a very boring state, since then there are no unique solutions and there are indeterminately many ways in which it might be inconsistent. But to count boringness as a criticism—of answers, I mean, not of questions—just shows that one is doing philosophy, or at any rate, not history.
The second misleading consequence of taking the history of philosophy, in the usual sense, as history, is that we think we have a rationale for doing it; for instance, in the sense of providing ourselves with the historical background of our own ideas. But if the study is not genuinely history, then it doesn’t provide us with the historical background to anything. These texts, of ancient provenance, bearing some largely indeterminate relation in our understanding to what they meant, are complex but ambiguous objects on which we project sets of philosophical ideas rather different in content from those we would be exercising in our own person. It may be interesting, helpful, instructive, even in some ways tell us about the past, but our justification for doing it, if there is one, can only very complexly be related to the fact that these men said what they said with certain meanings in the past. History of philosophy, and in particular, history of political philosophy, can, in principle, be made into history; but as it is most often done, especially in the spirit of analytical philosophy, it must be defended, if it is defensible, as a funny kind of philosophy with archaizing elements (something in the style of Stravinsky’s Pulcinella), rather than as irresponsible history.
CONCLUSION
I have touched, broadly, on a number of themes. I have implied, without saying, that the political philosopher must be in touch with moral philosophy, and have said that, freed from the narrower preoccupations of the fact-value distinction, he will have the opportunity and the need to study substantial complex value notions, not merely in their conceptual interrelations, narrowly conceived, but in the background of beliefs and non-moral conceptions which give them sense; and that in this, his work must certainly interrelate closely with that of the social sciences. I have suggested that his work may require now a particular kind of reflexive sensitivity which is likely to be assisted by a study of epistemological issues in relation to the social sciences; and one may add, the natural sciences, too. He should have a sense of the systematic demands of philosophy without demanding a system within moral or political philosophy themselves; and he should help in some respects to keep alive the sense of genuine moral conflicts, the origins of which we may well understand, but which are prone to be prematurely rationalized out of existence. One area in which he may usefully be able to do this is the development of more complex and realistic structures in decision theory.
This leaves the question which so bothered many analytical philosophers of the fact-value persuasion: By what right can a philosopher claim the attention of an audience on these themes, especially if—as I, certainly, have taken for granted—his concerns will be in some part normative? It seems to me an encouraging sign of how far philosophy has come in the past fifteen or even ten years, that this question, which seemed so honestly pressing at one time, should seem so boring now. For its answer clearly is that he has whatever claim any adult and reflective person may have on the attention of others if he has thoughts about some important subject. He can sacrifice that claim, or fail to deliver on it, in as many ways as there are of writing words which are dead, unimaginative, stupid, ill-informed, and so forth. Since he is a philosopher, his claim to attention is more likely to be, as always, weighted towards the end of subtle analysis and the fact that some of his claims follow from others than, for instance, to lie in a wide and seasoned experience of men and events; but to suppose that that is all and only what should be asked of him, is from all points of view idiotic.
In saying that, and throughout, I have in mind still one who is doing analytical philosophy. I have spoken critically of some earlier limitations of the genre, but as I said at the beginning, I do not think that reform has changed or will change it out of all recognition. It would be pointless and unhelpful now, any more than at the beginning, to say what I take its defining characteristics to be, if indeed it has definite bounds. I take a generous view of it, but certainly much which is called philosophy is excluded. It is cheering that in political philosophy it has survived its regeneration into something interesting, with its undoubted virtues intact. In its insistence, at its best, on the values of unambiguous statement and recognizable argument; its patience; its lack of contempt for the familiar; its willingness to meet with the formal and natural sciences; its capacity for genuine and discussable progress—in all this, and despite its many and often catalogued limitations, it remains the only real philosophy there is.
1 This is to imply that the study of the conceptual interrelations of a group’s outlook forms part of the social scientific study of that group. It does not imply that it forms more than part. The idea that social science is, more than everything else, conceptual investigation (cf. Winch) is a quite different, and to me unacceptable, position.
