Plato Today, by R.H.S. Crossman
Twenty-five years ago Plato’s Republic was generally viewed as one of the noblest monuments of Western liberalism and enlightenment. Together with the funeral speech which Thucydides in his history put into the mouth of Pericles, it was thought to represent the summit of Greek political wisdom and moral aspiration, and thus to be a primer and inspiration for the rulers and chief administrators who drew their education from the classics. This view of Plato’s politics has not entirely disappeared, and no doubt still gets an occasional airing at public-school speech days; but effectively it has gone, shown up for the extraordinary tissue of historical falsehood and philosophical misunderstanding that it always was. Its disappearance from serious discussion is in this country chiefly associated with Professor Popper’s massive engine of destruction, The Open Society and Its Enemies; but already in 1937 it had suffered a good deal of damage from the lighter, but still telling, weapons which Mr. Crossman deployed in his Plato Today.1 This ingenious and stimulating book has now happily been re-issued, with a few changes and a brief new introduction in which Crossman disarmingly gives his reasons for not changing more.
The oddest thing about the once popular view of Plato is that anyone should have believed it. It needed less knowledge of Greek history than was possessed by Plato’s admirers to realise that Platonic political theory represents not the finest philosophical expression of Athenian ideals, but a violent reaction against Athenian democracy and Pericles. Moreover, it needed only a reading of the Republic itself, or so one would have thought, to recognise the political system recommended there as a sclerotic monstrosity, high-principled in intent, but ultimately—and explicitly—based on oligarchic deceit and a contempt for much legitimate aspiration and human diversity. That well-informed and humane persons should have mistaken this either for an ideal embodiment of the principles of the Periclean Funeral Speech, or for a decent form of human life, is surprising.
The first, historical, mistake is chiefly explained, as Crossman remarks, by the refusal to think historically about Plato’s political ideas at all. Part of Crossman’s book is concerned with filling in the historical background, particularly of Plato’s life. It is vividly done; scholarly eyebrows will be raised over some of it, but the main points are firmly made, and one comes out with a genuine understanding of Greek politics. More general doubts may be felt about Crossman’s treatment of Socrates. He anticipates the line taken by Popper: that Socrates, unlike Plato, was a genuine ‘democrat’, an anti-authoritarian questioner who was executed for making a nuisance of himself to the tyrannically complacent. This may be true, but it is harder to prove historically than Crossman or Popper allows. We know that Socrates was associated with an anti-democratic clique, and that his execution was connected with this. Admitting as much, Crossman argues both that Socrates was a democrat and, indeed, a saint, and that the democratic faction which executed him was politically justified in doing so. This curious piece of jugglery seems indicative of more than merely historical uncertainty.
On the question of Plato’s political reputation—why his system should have been thought admirable by people who ought to have known better—Crossman has interesting things to say, both directly and indirectly. Directly, he suggests that a lot of people shrugged off Plato’s more repellent proposals by saying that they were the solutions of an idealist who did not consider the weaknesses of human nature; whereas, as Crossman admirably shows, Plato was obsessively aware of the weaknesses of human nature, and devised his rigid hierarchical structure precisely because he thought there was no other way of disciplining them. Crossman does not underestimate the power and subtlety of Plato’s pessimistic vision. It would have been interesting if he had gone on to discuss Plato’s theory of human nature, and to say something about the complex ways in which this theory allows Plato to represent as a system of consent what must actually be, on his own premises, a system of coercion.
Indirectly, Crossman points to other roots of the traditional admiration for the Republic when, in the non-historical part of his book, he imaginatively presents Plato’s views on such subjects as British democracy and British education, and suggests that these institutions are more Platonic in inspiration than may appear on the surface. He might profitably have added a Platonic estimate of Britain’s mission in the colonies. These parts of the book, in which ‘Plato’ is made to comment on twentieth-century problems, have lost little of their sparkle in twenty years. Some of it is fairly brittle, and Crossman is inclined to subscribe to what might be called the Gallic fallacy, of supposing that political institutions do not stand up to ‘rigorous logic’, when all that has been shown is that they do not stand up to rigorous logic proceeding from inadequate premises. But it is all provocative in the best sense—provocative of thought.
The book ends with an epilogue in which Crossman gives his own views on the Platonic issues of democracy and authority. It is brief and ultimately elusive; it combines in a dizzying way a virtually anarchical radicalism with a fascinated respect for the facts of power. There is an unresolved tension here—the same, surely, as broke out in the convoluted estimate of Socrates’ death. One wonders whether this book, which has in no way dated, shows us not only Plato, but Crossman today.2

English Philosophy since 1900, by G. J. Warnock
It is only in its title that this notably unpretentious book promises more than it gives.1 It is not a general account of English philosophy since 1900, as it omits moral and political philosophy altogether, and in other fields deals with the work of comparatively few philosophers, and that selectively. These limitations, however, are clearly stated by Mr. Warnock, who explains that his aim has been “to make as clear as possible the general character of the philosophical landscape”, and that he has deliberately given brief treatment to subjects, such as Logical Atomism, which have been studied recently in other works. The result of these various restrictions is a spare, elegant little book, admirably clear and very well written.
Its simplicity and clarity, however, are not the products only of restricted concerns and expository skill. It has the basic straightforwardness of a moral tale. At the start we are presented with the macabre picture of British Idealism, intellectually corrupt, fraudulent, staggering to its end in delusions of grandeur. Coming from foreign places, its rule was never more than the tyranny of occupation; and the rise of the hero, Moore, to drive it out is an affirmation not only of the light against the dark but of the native against the exotic. In the ensuing struggles, Moore has his allies, not always reliable: Russell, brave but unsteady; Positivism, secretly in love with the metaphysical enemy. The epic of Wittgenstein is also told, not without a slight sense of strain at having to take so extravagant a figure so seriously. With Ryle, victorious peace is almost achieved; and the story ends with Common Sense again on the throne, and the citizens of Oxford, calm but not idle, earning the unambitious rewards of honest toil.
It should be said that Mr. Warnock’s account is not quite as simple as this, and certainly the main divergences between the philosophers he considers are sharply observed and clearly set down. Yet, as he warns us, his preferences are not concealed; it is Moore, and Moore as the defender of Common Sense, who emerges as the most original and important contributor to recent philosophy, and it is in terms of this judgment that the whole account is given. The presuppositions behind this judgment also emerge very distinctly, and it is perhaps the nature of these, and the frankness with which they are revealed, that give the book its undoubted interest and, in a sense, appeal.
The basic presupposition is that metaphysical theses, and even metaphysical perplexity, are always the products, direct or indirect, of theorists, either philosophical or scientific. In a natural state, unharried by theorists, we all hold the “Common Sense view of the world”, which is (as Mr. Warnock says Moore found it to be) “perfectly unsurprising, undistressing, quite certainly true” (p. 55). Indeed, it seems that even the activities of theorists can never more than momentarily upset this view of the world: “It appears to me most evidently true that, in its simple foundations, our ordinary ‘way of seeing’ the world is absolutely stable and obstinately unshakeable … It is doubtful how far even Berkeley was able to retain the full sense of his vision for more than an occasional moment; one cannot so easily shake off what is natural to one’s species” (p. 142). One result of this is that persons who claim seriously to be metaphysically disturbed are likely to be either in an unbalanced state or, quite possibly, insincere; those who are not will be relieved to learn that “to practise philosophy in the manner of Moore, it is not necessary to have (as most of us doubtless have not) nor to pretend to have (as some at least would be unwilling to do) large-scale metaphysical anxieties” (p. 55). This view of the origin and nature of metaphysical disturbance is a parallel—one might almost say, a recurrence—of a Rousseauesque view of the natural man corrupted by the machinations of priests and kings.
Now one might admit that in the matter of metaphysical scepticism about such things as the existence of the external world, there is something in the Moorean claim that no sane person seriously doubts the truth of “common-sense” beliefs. But even in this sort of case, it is most implausible to suggest that the origin of metaphysical doubts lies in the activities of theorists. For instance, Mr. Warnock considers the metaphysical view of the mind (closely related to scepticism about the external world) as a “man inside”. He mentions, and rejects, the idea that the roots of this view lie already in the structure of our ordinary language about the mind, and finds a ready diagnosis of the trouble in a misunderstanding of the findings of neurophysiology and a tendency to assimilate the workings of the nervous system to the familiar workings of a telephone exchange. This diagnosis is absurd. For “the man inside” is already there with Descartes, and (though he was not worried by solipsism) as good as there with Plato—neither of whom—not even Descartes—was driven to the picture by reflections on neurophysiology, nor, one supposes, the telephone exchange. Of course, both were “theorists”; but the naturalness of such a picture for Plato, and the apparent cogency of Descartes’ meditations, might suggest that “the man inside” is something which they found as theorists rather than invented. It is surely not irrelevant in this connection that the belief in some sort of human soul, possibly separable from the body, seems to be about as old as the human race, and so, presumably, not younger than “common sense”. The idea, however, that there is naturally a problem about consciousness, and that “the man inside” is a picture naturally associated with this problem and lurking even in common sense, is not sympathetic to Mr. Warnock.
It is not clear how far Mr. Warnock confines the “priests and kings” thesis to such matters as the existence of the external world. At some points he seems to suggest that any form of “large-scale metaphysical anxiety” is gratuitous; elsewhere he admits that there are periods when at least some forms of metaphysical anxiety would be at least not patently insincere. The present time, however, is not one of them. In a chapter where he considers and seeks to justify a lack of metaphysical disturbance among present Oxford-style philosophers, he mentions the previous associations of metaphysics and religion, and goes on to say: “(metaphysics) could be expected to show some decline when very many people neither have, nor appear to be much oppressed by the want of, any serious religious convictions … Metaphysics, like religion, ought not to be manufactured in deference to any supposed requirements of intellectual decorum, or in the pursuit of some once genuine fervour which, in present conditions, would be synthetic or simulated” (p. 145). These are honourable remarks, inasmuch as, if there is nothing to be worried about, it is certainly dishonourable to simulate worry. Their suggestion, however, seems to be that there is at present nothing to be metaphysically worried about: if this were not the suggestion, the statement that many people are not worried would be merely irrelevant, and no justification of metaphysical inactivity would have been given. And this suggestion is downright astonishing. In fact the whole underlying thesis of this book is astonishing; all the more so for the air with which Mr. Warnock presents it, as one soberly recognizing obvious truths which incomprehensibly escape the notice of others.
It is unhappily probable that some readers, particularly among the unprofessional audience for whom the book is chiefly intended, may be tempted, in their puzzlement at this attitude, to diagnose it merely as a certain parochial and academic complacency. This uncharitable reaction would be over-hasty: the sensitivity with which the book is written, the acuteness of its reasoning, and its moral overtones, all demand some deeper characterization of its implausibility. Such a characterization really awaits a proper study of the concept of “common sense” and of the peculiar role it plays in some contemporary philosophy. However, one might say in general that what the attitude of Mr. Warnock’s book is most like is that of a work of metaphysics; there is much the same difference between this attitude and complacency as there is between Leibniz and Pangloss. As in some works of metaphysics, notable intelligence is deployed in distorting the facts of human experience to fit an extremely simple view of human nature, science, and philosophy. It would be unfair not to add that, like such works, the present book derives from this activity a genuine unity and even a certain fascination.2

Thought and Action, by Stuart Hampshire
The chief and persistent influence on British philosophical thought about the human mind has been Descartes. To say this may seem a paradox, since there is no more hallowed contrast in the history of philosophy than that between on the one hand the rationalism of Descartes, with its far-reaching trust in the powers of pure theoretical reason to discover the ultimate structure of reality, and on the other hand the profound empiricist strain of British thought, which has again and again returned to the view that nothing substantial can be learned about the world save through the laborious, tentative, and always corrigible process of generalising from sense-experience and empirical observation.
Nor is this hallowed contrast confined to abstract philosophical opinions about the nature of science. It is equally a platitude—though a much vaguer one—to contrast a certain abstract and theoretical spirit more generally present in French thought with the more cautious, down-to-earth, and perhaps pedestrian temper of English intellectual activities. These contrasts are of course very rough and ready, and, in their more general form, a great deal of rubbish has been talked about them by both the contrasted parties. For all that, there is something in this platitudinous distinction; how then can it be that the prevailing influence on British philosophy of mind is nevertheless Descartes?
There are three main ways, I think, in which it is so. First, British philosophers have constantly returned to Descartes’ fundamental belief, that the mind is in some fundamental sense distinct from the body, and that knowledge of the mind, its contents and activities, is more direct than, and is not reached through, our knowledge of the “external” world, where included in the external world are our bodies. This belief, in different forms, is to be found in the three pillars of British empiricism, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume, and once more in the logical positivism famously expounded in A. J. Ayer’s Language, Truth, and Logic. It is only recently that this belief has been fundamentally challenged, in, for instance, Gilbert Ryle’s Concept of Mind and the later work of Wittgenstein.
The second point of contact between the British tradition and Descartes is rather different. It lies in their common neglect of, indeed contempt for, history as a form of human knowledge, and of historical understanding as a vital part of man’s understanding of his world. Although the British tradition differed from Descartes about the nature and methods of natural science, it shared his belief that natural science was the paradigm of human knowledge. Natural science seeks, and seems able to attain, knowledge of universal truths about the world, which hold irrespective of time and place; compared with this, historical study, immersed in the unsystematically particular, may seem a poor thing.
The third point of contact is to be found in a comparable neglect of æsthetics. For Descartes, our experience of art could scarcely appear as a form of knowledge or rational activity at all, and he accordingly has nothing to say of it. The poverty of British æsthetics, at least among philosophers, is notorious. This point is certainly connected with the last, and it is significant that the two British thinkers who are outstanding exceptions to the prevailing neglect of history—Burke and Collingwood—are exceptional also in having serious views about the nature of art. Of course, there is an important difference between the neglect of these things by Descartes, and their continuing neglect by the British tradition: the latter needs explanation, while the former scarcely does. Descartes, a scientist and mathematician in the 17th century, was almost bound to take such a view; what is odd is that in Britain it should persist so indomitably to the present day. I suspect that the explanation constitutes a rather engaging paradox of the history of ideas: it is precisely the empirical and cautious temper of British philosophers that has left them in this curious, perhaps not entirely recognised, alliance with the rationalist Descartes. The elevation of historical understanding and æsthetic experience to central places in the picture of man’s consciousness took place, after all, amid the deep metaphysical thunder of 19th-century Germany, above all in Hegel. While the influence of Hegel radically changed the rest of European thought, and continues to work in it, the sceptical caution of British philosophy left it spectacularly immune to it—splendidly, but to its undoubted loss.
It is necessary, I think, to bear in mind these continuing Cartesian characteristics of the British philosophy of mind to appreciate fully the originality of Stuart Hampshire’s book.1 It is not just that he adopts an anti-Cartesian view of mind and body: this has been seen recently, in the work of Wittgenstein and elsewhere (although Hampshire’s own views take an importantly different direction from most of what has appeared). More immediately remarkable, at least, is the way in which his book runs against the other two traditions. Throughout the book Hampshire shows that he regards historical understanding as essential to grasping all but the absolutely basic characteristics of the human mind. There are some features of human thought that are basic and essential, those that follow from man’s nature as a bodily creature in a world of solid objects, who can move and act in this world, and communicate with others of his kind with whom he lives in society. Beyond this minimum, however (and one of Hampshire’s chief concerns is to determine what this minimum is), the forms that human thought takes, the structure of language, the content of morality, the styles of art, are to be understood historically. All our ways of thinking about the world are conditioned by a given historical context of conventions, manners, and interests; hence also they inevitably change. Thus in anything that concerns human thought and achievement, there are, if any, very few final truths. Hampshire is prepared, indeed, to take the step, not common with philosophers, of applying this conclusion to his own theories: all “determinations of the powers of the mind,” any theoretical picture of the nature and interdependence of human capabilities and characteristics, must be provisional, his own not excepted.
This concern for the historical dimension runs, though not always obviously, all through the book. His concern for æsthetics is equally deep, but shows itself only towards the end of the book, where he makes it clear that in his view no philosophical theory of mind can be complete unless it gives some account of the universal human desire to produce and appreciate works of art.
Thought and Action covers a large range of topics, from the nature of language and linguistic reference, via the nature of intention and intentional action, to the freedom of the will and morality. In this, too, it is distinguished from much contemporary British work. Hampshire writes in his introduction:
It has been the discipline of this time to answer separable questions separately, to analyse complex difficulties into elementary difficulties. The rewards of this discipline have been very great: accuracy, clarity, and sometimes even conclusiveness. But it is possible that there are purposes and interests which require that accurate and step-by-step analysis should not always be preferred to a more general survey and more tentative opinions, even in philosophy.
Such a general survey he attempts, and the result is a book of extraordinary sweep, often sketchy and tentative in the connections of its argument, but rich in the variety and novelty of the considerations it assembles.
The free and diverse moment of its thought makes this an exciting and stimulating book; it does not, however, make a book notably easy to digest or summarise. Nor is it made any easier in these respects by the way in which the exposition is put together. The style is extremely graceful, but its literary merits go with a refusal to use the more ponderous devices of footnote and reference which, like metal spikes in mountain-climbing, may be inelegant but do help one over the steep places. In the first chapter, for instance, a number of pages are devoted to arguments which are in fact objections to views held about perception by the logical positivists and similar thinkers, but there is nothing in the text to tell one this. It would also have been helpful, I think, to get us to see the direction of his views, had Hampshire made references to writers whose opinions on various topics he either shares or has been interestingly influenced by. Some of what he says about action and self-knowledge, for instance, bears important relations to some French writing which has not previously had much effect in this country: to Sartre and, in particular, Merleau-Ponty, among contemporaries, and to an earlier tradition going back to Maine de Biran.
Hampshire’s austerity in such matters extends also to the devices of cross-reference, sub-heading, and so on; the book is a painting rather than a blue-print, a plant and not an engine. The argument grows, winds, doubles back; and, like a tendril, it tends to proceed spirally, returning to a side of the question it has visited before, but now a little further on. Its direction is not always easily followed, but it has a direction.
The general direction is, very roughly put, something like this. Hampshire starts from the question of what it is for us to be able to talk about the world, and finds as necessary for this our ability to pick out and refer to enduring objects in our environment. What sorts of distinctions we make, and what sorts of similarities we perceive, between features of the environment will to a great extent be a product of society, convention, and history; but that we do identify and refer to enduring objects is a necessary part of our having a language at all. In all these opening sections in particular, Hampshire’s argument can be seen as revolving round the old distinction between what is “natural” and what is “conventional”; the possibility of language has a natural basis in the activity of pointing, but so long as this basic pointing function is preserved, the forms of a particular language will be conventional.
Hampshire then goes on to argue, in a number of interestingly different ways, that the possibility of language, and so of any conscious thought, presupposes that the beings who use the language should be able to move and act in the world. Here he rejects an important Cartesian idea, that we could image a conscious being whose experience was purely passive, who was a mere recipient of experiences. Such a being, for Hampshire, could not think about or have any concept of his experiences, for mere experiences could not satisfy the conditions of reference and identification necessary for conscious thought. (Here it is that Hampshire argues against the logical positivists; some of his arguments are similar to later views of Wittgenstein.2) In order to be able to identify and refer, we must be able to perceive enduring objects distinct from ourselves; the notion of perceiving presupposes that of being able to perceive things from different points of view—for it is precisely this that distinguishes genuine perception from illusion. The notion of perceiving things from different points of view presupposes, in turn, the idea that I can move about in the world, and orientate myself, as a bodily object, in relation to other objects.
The idea of moving myself is then taken up and connected with the notions of action and intention. These notions are, in Hampshire’s view—here again a radical departure from Cartesianism—connected with my ability to have direct knowledge of what I am doing or trying to do: “it is essential to the idea of an action,” he writes, “that a person’s knowledge that an action of his is his own action is not the conclusion of an inference.” This knowledge that I have of what I am doing, though in certain cases it may indeed be minimal, is always with me when I am conscious. If someone is conscious, then there is always an answer to the question “what is he doing?”; and a man’s own knowledge of what he is doing, not merely in some instantaneous sense, but in the sense of a project in which he is engaged which reaches out beyond the present moment, is the foundation of a man’s consciousness of his own identity. (Here Hampshire comes particularly close to phenomenological thinkers such as Merleau-Ponty.)
From this point, two lines of thought in particular are taken up. First, some connections are explored between the idea of action and that of thinking or more generally having conscious psychological experiences. So far from the latter being contrasted with action, as it always has been in the Cartesian tradition, Hampshire finds the two to be intimately connected. So far from an emotion, for instance, being a merely passive experience which may, as a matter of fact, lead to or cause overt action, it is rather, according to Hampshire, a kind of inhibited action; the emotion of anger, for instance, is to be understood as a by-product of the activity, itself rather sophisticated, of stopping myself lashing out or something similar. Similarly, the “psychological state” of belief is to be understood as a kind of inhibited assertion. (These somewhat paradoxical statements may be an oversimplification of Hampshire’s view. I suspect, however, that the view as it stands is in any case rather paradoxical.)
The second line of thought pursued from here is an exploration of the notion of “practical knowledge” and its connections with intention. Hampshire holds, if I understand him, that there are two sorts of such knowledge. One is a certain “non-propositional” knowledge, which a man has when he knows what he is going to do or, more particularly, how he is going to do something, but has no words in which he could describe this. Thus an actor, for instance, may know how he means to play his part in the sense that he can show you how he does it, and can recognise if it has failed to come off, but could not describe how he was going to do it. The other sort is propositional: a man can tell you what he is going to do, in the form of a definite statement of intention.
Statements of intention are contrasted with predictions of what a man will do, and it is argued that there is a sense in which the two cannot be combined: a man cannot intend to do a certain thing if he knows on independent grounds, say some considerations of psychology, that he is going to do the thing anyway. This consideration introduces a doctrine of freedom. I am free, roughly speaking, in so far as my actual actions match my genuine intentions and projects. In particular, the neurotic is not free, since he is constantly frustrated in what he is consciously trying to bring about. In his case, this is because there is something else which in a rather different, subconscious sense, he is trying to do; the way to liberation is through an increased self-consciousness which it is the aim of psycho-analysis to bring about. Here Hampshire (like Spinoza, on whom he earlier wrote a book3) connects the idea of freedom with that of self-knowledge, and, by connecting this notion with the doctrines of Freud, tries to give an interpretation of free and responsible action which will avoid the difficulties and obscurities of the bare notion of the freedom of the will, as it has been inherited from Kant and the Christian tradition.
Finally, these notions of freedom and responsibility are applied, rather briefly, to an account of morality and the relations of morality and art. In Hampshire’s view, the central notion of morality is not, for instance, that of obligation or duty, but that of a good man. He shares with Aristotle the idea that to say of a man that he is good is to say that he is perfect, fully-developed, as a man; almost, that he is an excellent specimen of the type “man.” Every morality, accordingly, must contain as its central notion an idea of what a man should be, some doctrine of what is essentially human excellence. Such a notion Hampshire himself seeks to develop in outline from what he has said about the nature of man; in particular, the perfect man must be one who is to the fullest extent free, whose projects are based on a rational understanding of his own dispositions and capabilities, and which accordingly are not destroyed or frustrated by features of himself for which he has not allowed.
Merely from this summary (and I have left a lot out) it will be seen that the book contains a multitude of ideas variously and suggestively connected together. There is a good deal in the book that will certainly provoke doubt and disagreement. In particular, it is unclear that Hampshire has made his case about pointing as the natural foundation of linguistic reference; it may well be that pointing itself, in the sense that is required, is something that presupposes a linguistic context. On the relation between different sorts of intention, again, Hampshire’s thesis is obscure, both in respect of the “non-propositional” sort of knowledge of my intentions, and in the relations between the doctrine that to act intentionally involves having a certain sort of knowledge of what I am doing, and the assertion, which Hampshire thinks appropriate to neurotic behaviour, that a man may act in ignorance of his real intentions. The account of morality, further, is markedly schematic and incomplete, and some well-known difficulties in the Aristotelian notion that to be a good man is, roughly, to be good at being a man, are not really answered. More general criticism of the chapter on morality will also occur to the reader; whether, for instance, the rough picture of the good life (remarkably like Spinoza’s in its tone of anti-romantic heroism) could serve for other than a rather special sort of life attainable only in favourable circumstances, and whether allowance has been made for the somewhat unsympathetic consequences of this; and whether Hampshire has not incorporated into the notion of morality itself considerations that unduly narrow the concept, so that certain sorts of morality—religious morality, for instance—become on his view well-nigh incomprehensible.
It will be a long, and fruitful, task for anyone interested in human thought and morality to discuss the difficulties of Hampshire’s book. I should like to end by raising just one, more general, sort of criticism. It is my impression that Hampshire’s account pays insufficient attention to the applications of natural science to human behaviour, and that some of his distinctions and conclusions may well be called in question when one considers the possible advances in these sciences or even, in some cases, their present state. Now Hampshire certainly denies this, and part of his purpose, like that of Spinoza, is indeed to give an account of human action and freedom compatible with scientific enquiry into the mind. His success in this purpose, however, seems much less striking when the scientific advances for which his position is prepared turn out to be those of psycho-analysis—“the new positive science of human conduct”, as he optimistically terms it. To say that a view of human freedom is compatible with scientific advance because it is compatible with developments in psycho-analysis is much like saying that a material is uninflammable because it doesn’t burst into flames when one shines an electric torch light on it. This is all the more so in Hampshire’s case because he takes a markedly non-deterministic interpretation of psycho-analysis, considering it in effect as a theory of freedom. This is certainly a possible interpretation of psycho-analysis, and it may well be the most illuminating. However, it is only dubiously compatible with a good deal of what Freud, at least, says, and perhaps makes it even less clear than before, if this is possible, in what sense psycho-analysis is a positive science at all.
The really effective enemy against which theories of freedom should be prepared is not psycho-analysis but the neuro-physiology of the brain, and of this Hampshire has nothing to say. It may well be that a good number of his reflections on freedom would withstand any advance in this science as well; I think it is so. But the real enemy should be faced. It may be that Hampshire in fact thinks that neuro-physiology could not possibly advance to the point where it could yield substantial predictions of human behaviour. If so, arguments should be produced—it is a risky sort of claim.
There is another branch of natural science, too, to which Hampshire might have given more consideration. This is zoology; here the point is not that he should have made room for advances in science, but that consideration of its findings might well have modified the rigidity of some of his distinctions. For Hampshire, human action seems to be radically distinct from any other animal behaviour. Now this is in a sense true, in so far as the human possession of language and self-consciousness (which Hampshire rightly connects together) constitutes an enormous conceptual difference in our views of human and of other animal behaviour. But it does not follow from this that the behaviour of other animals is really mechanical, while ours is not; nor that the interpretation of animal behaviour as purposive consists only in reading into a stimulus-response system a pattern merely analogous to a pattern familiar in human action.
It is unclear how far Hampshire accepts this kind of conclusion, but he seems to me tempted to it. Thus, while admitting that animal behaviour is purposive in some sense or other, he certainly denies that we can attribute intentions to animals. Here I suspect Hampshire goes wrong in his concept of intention. It is true that we cannot ascribe sensibly to an animal an intention to do something in the future, which it has not yet embarked on. This is because it makes no sense to think of an animal using temporal ideas, save perhaps in the most rudimentary behavioural contexts. It does not follow from this, however, as Hampshire’s concept of intention leads him to infer, that it makes no sense to apply to an animal the concept of its intention in doing what it is doing. We can distinguish in the case of an animal, as we can with human beings, between what it is really doing, in the sense of what it is primarily up to, and the things that are merely concomitants of what it is doing. Thus what the dog may be really doing is digging for a bone, or digging a hole: not, in the same primary sense, turning over so many stones or making a scratching noise, though it is also doing these things. Of course the evidences for this will be different from those available in a comparable case of a human being, whom we can ask what he is doing. But to say that therefore the concept of intention in doing such-and-such therefore does not apply to animals suggests to me an excessively anthropocentric concept of intention; we can and must in the case of complex animal behaviour draw the distinction between what is really being done and what is concomitant, and this seems to me one firm ground of the concept of intention.
This is a highly complex question, and no simple view can be had on it. Yet I feel that as a matter of attitude, to put it no stronger, that had Hampshire had more vividly in mind the astonishing complexities of animal behaviour, and the marked continuities, not only of reaction, but of patterns of purposive action between the other animals and man, he would have allowed concepts of action and intention not so totally restricted to human activities.
Descartes, it will be remembered, thought that animals were machines; perhaps Hampshire’s view of animal behaviour constitutes the last Cartesian element in this profound and original anti-Cartesian book.

The Theological Appearance of the Church of England: An External View
My disqualifications for writing about this subject are many; I must start by declaring some. I am not a member of the Church of England, and thus may be suspected of being biassed against it, or at least lacking in sympathy with it. The fact that I am not a member of any other church, either, may do something to alleviate the first suspicion, but may, on the other hand, only tend to aggravate the second, since it may be thought that only Christians are likely to show much understanding in questions of Christian theology. To a certain extent, this must of course be admitted: a theology is not something that can just be “got up”, or completely understood from the outside. Nevertheless, it surely cannot be that unbelief is a complete bar to discussion, if the Church is to speak, not only with itself, but with those outside—which is surely what the Church must hope to do. So I hope that some unpolemical remarks from someone outside will not necessarily and completely lack point.
Since I belong to no church, it will be seen that my reasons for unbelief do not consist merely of objections to Anglicanism, but are more general than that. It is not my aim here, however, to raise these general difficulties. I shall merely try to discuss some features of the Anglican position today, as I understand it. Here I shall make the last of my introductory apologies: that I have no doubt that I understand it very imperfectly. Perhaps some of the things I say will be merely misunderstandings. I do hope, though, that if they are misunderstandings, they are not merely personal misunderstandings, but misunderstandings shared with others outside the Church who take an interest in it. If so—and discussions I have had with others suggest that it is so—perhaps I can hope that even my mistakes will have some symptomatic kind of interest.
I have spoken of “the Anglican position”. But one immediate and notorious difficulty is that of identifying an Anglican position at all. Quot Anglicani, tot sententiae would be an unfair exaggeration, but the despairing enquirer has been known to think it. The variation of Anglican opinion is a familiar, but not a trivial, difficulty. There are those who do not find it a difficulty, but rather a recommendation, indicative of a wide freedom of conscience. It seems to me, however, that it undoubtedly is a difficulty, even if not an insuperable one; because the Anglican Church does offer itself to those outside as a church, and it is as a church that they are invited to join it. It would not be a church if it were only a kind of federation of beliefs, a label that could be worn without bad conscience by anyone from a Roman Catholic minus Papal infallibility to a Methodist plus bishops. The Anglican Church is not, of course, merely this, but it sometimes seems so; and its seeming so is the reason why its great variation of belief is indeed a difficulty.
It is a platitude to contrast the Church of England in this respect with the Church of Rome. It is important, however, what the point of this contrast is. It is not that the Church of Rome presents in all places uniformly the same appearance; it obviously does not. The point is that with the Church of Rome there is in the end a more or less determinate procedure for discovering what are the central and essential beliefs, and what are local variations, and with the Anglican Church there is not—or, at least, there does not seem to be. It may be objected that Rome earns these advantages by the devices of dogmatic pronouncement and excommunication, repugnant to the Anglican position. This may well be true, but it misses the present point. For it is not being suggested that the Church of England should have the same body of essential belief as Rome, or any as elaborate; but only that there should be some central body of beliefs common to all. If it is now suggested that devices of excommunication, etc., are necessary to preserve even that minimum uniformity in the Anglican Church, the questioner will surely be justified in thinking that the raison d’être of the Anglican Church as a distinct entity is hard to find.
It will be said that such a minimum uniformity of belief indeed exists. But it is not always easy to believe this; for while the same words can be heard more or less from all, the sense that is attached to these words is certainly various. This is a point I shall come back to. Even if there is a central core, however, it should still be made clearer what is the central core, and what the individual variations. When I say that this should be made clearer, I mean among other things that one should be able to discover this by asking those in orders. Here one touches on another notorious contrast with the Church of Rome, that, very broadly speaking, the average Roman Catholic priest seems to be more thoroughly theologically educated (if I may use the expression) than the average clergyman. This is a very well-known point, which raises questions of the training for the priesthood beyond my scope; I only want to make the point, if it needs making, that this difference undoubtedly affects the status of the Anglican Church in the eyes of the intelligent enquirer.
The point needs making, I think, if only because there seem to be many Anglicans, and some in orders, who find an emphasis on theology irrelevant. These will tend, if questioned about the Church, to point primarily to its social work and moral influence. Now there is no doubt that the Church must show itself socially, and in the broader sense politically, concerned; because—to put the point only in crudely tactical terms—it still undeniably has an unfortunate “class image” to live down. It is no accident that both Roman Catholicism and Nonconformism have such powerful roots among working people. But, obviously, there is no point in this social work without a Christian significance, and there will be no Christian significance without a theology. It is only if behind social and moral action there is a belief, and a belief which to some extent can be explained, that the unbeliever will not be justified in merely replying that he prefers his social work without fancy dress.
This may seem quite platitudinous. I hope it is; I would be more convinced that it was if one did not quite often encounter Anglicans—again, unhappily, some in orders—whose views on the relation between their belief and their social or personal morality were quite inadequate. There are those whose religion turns out just to be their morality, whose religious outlook really can be described as “morality tinged with emotion”. Others go beyond this, only to introduce God as the crudest kind of sanction for morality. I have myself been addressed by a R.A.F. chaplain who told us that, after all, one wouldn’t steal if somebody were watching, and the thing about God is that he is watching one all the time … It was unclear whether this curious consideration was supposed to mean that because God exists, one shouldn’t steal, or that because one knows that one shouldn’t steal, one can see that God exists. I got the impression that the chaplain didn’t mind which he meant.
One would have to be very uncharitable to hold such individual idiocies against the Church as a whole. But they do not help it, and steps should be taken to see that no clergyman goes out to represent the Church without a deeper and sounder moral theology. This merely reverts to the training question. There are at least two points, however, on which I have the impression that the Church as a whole needs deeper thought about its moral theology. One concerns the relation between such things in this life as the improvement of living conditions, and the hope of eternal salvation which is said to be the end of the Christian life. It seems possible that these two should conflict: so far as those whose lot is to be bettered are concerned, it is certainly not self-evident that material betterment will improve their chances of living the kind of life which, we are told, is likely to lead to salvation. Some of the darker reactionaries in such places as the Spanish Roman Church notoriously see this point, and holding that their task is to lead souls to salvation and that this life is only a drop in eternity, oppose a good deal of social reform. Some Christians dismiss this view too lightly—it has a kind of savage consistency. If they are to reject this view, as all Anglicans presumably will, they must put something in its place. One simple way is to say that it is a known Christian duty to aid others less fortunate than oneself, and in performing this duty, one pursues one’s own way to salvation. But put just like that, this sounds too self-regarding, as though one were making others the instruments of one’s own salvation. If it is replied that this is a superficial objection, because the duty in question is precisely not to be self-regarding, but to love others as oneself, a difficulty still remains: for the duty is presumably not to love them and aid them merely as temporal human beings with material wants, but as children of God destined, in his Grace, to salvation. The question then remains, whether the right way of expressing love to men in this character is in all cases to work for their social betterment. Nor will it resolve the difficulty to warn the doubter against the presumption of considering the salvation of others, and to urge him to leave that to them and God, and concern himself with his own; for the doubt will remain, whether pursuing these policies of social betterment is the way for him to concern himself with his own salvation.
This is a practical problem, and a deep problem of the relations, for a Christian, of time and eternity. Many Anglicans seem not to have given enough thought to it.
The second point about moral theology is a yet more general one. Unbelievers often say in a truculent tone that the lives of Christians don’t seem all that different from the lives of others. This may just be the relatively superficial point that they don’t seem to be much better men; about this the Christian has things, sufficiently familiar, to say. But when those things have been said, a deeper point remains. For even if one granted what the Christian has to say of original sin and the ways in which things become harder if one is a Christian rather than easier, there remains the feeling that there should be a distinctively Christian way of thinking about moral problems, what might be called, for want of a better phrase, a Christian style of moral thought. Now there is such a thing; or, rather, there is more than one. There is, on the one side, what has come to be called “the Nonconformist conscience”. Admirable though its possessors often are, the doubter in the modern world, corrupted, perhaps, by complexity, knows that he cannot commit himself whole to its simplifications. On the other hand, there is a highly complex style of Roman Catholic moral thought. The heart of this style is casuistry—not in the pejorative sense, but in the strict sense of a method of moral argument that seeks to bring every action and character that is to be decided or judged under certain fixed categories of virtue or good deed, vice or sin. Here again the doubter must hesitate: surely he knows that things cannot be so fixed, that the categories must be open to revision, criticism, extension?
Between is the Church of England. But where? Here, it seems to me, it has both a lack and an opportunity. A lack, because as things are, it scarcely seems to have an individual style of moral thought. Exhortations to the imitatio Christi are not, by themselves, enough; up to a point, even the unbeliever can agree to do likewise, and beyond that point, there is need of precisely the kind of moral thinking in essentially Christian terms that is lacking. It has, however, also an opportunity, to find a style of thought more apposite to our complexities than the rigidities, respectively simple and complex, of its neighbours.
Moral theology is, of course, not self-sufficient. Behind it there must be a Christology; and this raises, in the first place, the questions of historicity. Christianity is said by all to be an historical religion, based not only on the facts of Christ’s life and crucifixion but on the Resurrection. It is also, I suppose, an historical religion in a rather different sense: it is a religion concerned, like its relatives Judaism and Islam, with its own history, and in particular concerned with the continuity of belief from its beginnings. Now the intelligent unbeliever knows this as well as the Christian does, and will not be impressed by attempts to duck the consequences of it. In particular, he probably recalls that S. Paul said, “If Christ be not risen, then is our faith vain”, and will tend very firmly to think that the moment Christians start shuffling on the historical claims for the Resurrection, they might as well shut up shop.
I should not have thought it necessary to say anything so obvious, had I not heard a very distinguished Anglican theologian being questioned closely for about twenty minutes on his belief in the Resurrection, at the end of which it was still not clear whether he thought that as a matter of historical fact Christ rose from the grave or not. There was a good deal of talk about “analogical sense”, “surviving spirit”; a theologian might have found in this a sad confusion between the events of Easter Sunday and those of Pentecost, but in brusquer terms, it was just a piece of unconscionable double-talk.
This raises again the question mentioned before, of the unity of belief. This theologian was quite prepared to say that Christ rose—the difficulties came when he was asked to say what he meant by it. This is a particularly striking case, of course, because in the case of the Resurrection there is no doubt at all about what the words, in their natural interpretation, do mean. It is not so with many theological doctrines. There are two quite different ways in which theological assertions may cause difficulty to the enquirer: they may be incredible, or they may be incomprehensible. The doctrine of the Resurrection, if it presents a difficulty, does so only by being incredible: it is perfectly clear what one is required to believe, only it is not easy to believe it. With such doctrines, if they are certainly part of the faith, it is no part of the theologian’s task to try to find a new meaning for the terms that express them. If he does so, he is certainly abandoning the religion. With doctrines such as the Incarnation and the Trinity, the situation is different, for the difficulty of these is their incomprehensibility: it is hard, not so much to believe them, as to take the preliminary step of recognising what has to be believed in order to believe them. It is of course essential that anything that is to be called Christianity contains these doctrines, and contains them moreover in a transcendental form, that is, in such a form that what is being asserted by them is not merely something, however “spiritual”, about the temporal life and personality of Christ. I have occasionally seen Anglican clergymen slipping nervously in what looked suspiciously like that direction, though it might be unfair to suppose that there was any such dilutionary tendency in Anglican thought as a whole.
Last one comes to the question of God’s existence, and of the arguments that can be given for it. It seems to me essential that there should be some arguments, and it has certainly been the tradition of the Church of England to give some. It is essential that there should be such arguments, not so much to persuade unbelievers—not many can have been converted by purely theological considerations—but in order to give some basis to what otherwise might be an utterly subjective feeling, and also to give content to the belief itself: the nature of the arguments itself gives clues to the nature of the God, the existence of whom they purport to prove. Thus the argument from the first cause illustrates God’s nature as Creator, the argument from moral experience his goodness and concern with mankind, etc.
In the matter of such arguments, the Church of England is in a peculiarly difficult historical position. It has been its traditional role, and one of its most English features, to rely on those arguments for God’s existence that have most empirical content, which appeal most to the observed nature of the world. Chief among these was the so-called Argument from Design, the argument from the evident purposiveness and fitness of natural things, to the existence of the Great Artificer. Such arguments (as Kant observed) are more satisfying, seem to have more real content, than the more abstract proofs from contingency, the nature of being, and so on, on which the Church of Rome has characteristically most relied. This is true, but there is a corresponding disadvantage. Empirical content is like income: the larger it is, the nicer, but also the more tax it attracts, the tax in the case of arguments being the likelihood of empirical refutation.
The tax-collector arrived in the form of the theory of evolution by natural selection; and it was because the Church of England was so attached to the Argument from Design that it experienced a convulsion over Darwinism of a sort that Rome (whose own crisis had come over Galileo) largely managed to avoid. Paley’s Watch had been the Church’s timepiece, and suddenly it stopped.
It is important to see what the difficulty is. It is not that Darwinism disproves the existence of God. The truth of Darwinism is not incompatible with the existence of God, even if it makes his choice of means seem even more mysterious than before. The difficulty for the Church was not that Darwin disproved their conclusion, but that he removed what was apparently the strongest argument they had for it. That argument depended essentially on pointing to something in the world which, it was alleged, could not be explained except on theological principles; Darwin did explain it on non-theological principles (or, to be fairer, his successors are progressively doing so); and this certainly removes the force from the Argument from Design.
The question “is science incompatible with religion?” is now generally seen to be too vague to admit of an answer. What is true is that there are certain arguments for religion, depending essentially on an appeal to the inexplicable, which do collapse under the advance of scientific explanation; and the Church of England seems to show an eery compulsion to embrace just such arguments. This compulsion still continues. Some Anglicans appeal to the emergence of life from the non-living, and so give hostages to bio-chemistry. Others appeal to the start of the universe, and give hostages to cosmology, which may show that there is no necessity to postulate any start to the universe at all. Others—and it is essentially the same sort of argument—appeal to the existence of religious experience, and so put themselves in the hands of psychological advance; for here again, while it would be quite possible to reconcile any psychological explanation of such experience with the existence of God, if we knew on other grounds that God existed, there is a very poor prognosis for a belief in God which is itself mainly based on the psychological inexplicability of those experiences.
Granted all this, there is of course always one question left, which one knows a priori could not be answered by any scientific advance: the question, sufficiently broadly taken, of why the universe exists at all. Since all scientific explanation depends essentially on explaining one part of the universe by reference to another, it cannot in principle explain the existence of the universe as a whole. The trouble is that when the question is taken as broadly as that, its meaning and compulsiveness may seem depressingly to evaporate. We have certainly moved a long way from the impressive workings, to be seen on every side, of Archbishop Paley’s Watch.
Here, clearly, the unbeliever can have nothing to say. Since he believes there to be no arguments which will prove this conclusion, he could not, if he dared, suggest where to look for them. But perhaps he may suggest that the Church of England make a more violent effort to detach itself from the damnosa hereditas of its addiction to the scientifically refutable, and find something else which will be more solid and enduring, and yet in keeping with its tradition of eschewing the more abstract and rarefied forms of argument in favour of the more familiar and compelling. If it can.
The Four Loves, by C. S. Lewis
The Four Loves are Affection, Friendship, Eros and Charity. In this brief book Professor Lewis discusses each; its difficulties, dangers and rewards.1 He starts off with an introductory chapter in which he principally distinguishes between what he calls Gift-loves and Need-loves—a distinction of some importance to his later thoughts, although he rightly admits its limitations, since there are many whose need it is to make a gift of their love. He also has a chapter on, as he puts it, our ‘liking and loves for the sub-human,’ and there speaks of such things as patriotism and the love for animals. On his title-page are the words of Donne: ‘that our affections kill us not, nor dye’; his aim is to show us a life full of, but not torn apart by, love, something only possible in his view if the love that crowns it is the love of God.
Perhaps we should not say that the author of this book is Professor Lewis. This is a work of the C. S. Lewis who wrote The Screwtape Letters, and it is appropriate (even if only a publisher’s convention) that the list of the author’s works on the fly-leaf does not include the history of sixteenth-century English literature, nor The Allegory of Love. It is not just that in books like this Lewis writes without professorial solemnity—that, indeed, is true of his critical works as well. It is rather that in approaching his present subject he jettisons that state of mind in which alone one could hope to learn from the literature of love, a state of mind that involves the suspension of assertion and a readiness for any degree of complexity. He starts afresh, with lots of good sense and a genuine humility, to put together some thoughts about his own and the general experience. This gives his work a first-handness not to be despised: it is not derivative or ‘literary’ in the bad sense.
Yet the price is high. By banishing from his mind that less general experience, those warnings of complexity, that the literature of love offers he hands himself over to his own particular demon—a kind of clubman’s crassness which can be heard over and over again in these pages striking a false note. Sometimes he merely expresses himself in a way that makes it hard to believe he can enjoy good writing: ‘If we were short of matter on this theme we could turn on the tap by opening the works of the Stoics and it would run till we had a bathful.’ Sometimes, particularly in religious matters, he uses some jarringly hearty analogy. Sometimes he throws up the discussion of a serious question with what seems almost a willed superficiality. Having raised the question of the connections, if any, between male friendship and what he calls ‘abnormal Eros,’ he ends a brief and combative discussion: ‘… and all those hairy old toughs of centurions in Tacitus, clinging to one another and begging for last kisses when the legion was broken up—all pansies? If you can believe that you can believe anything.’
These outbreaks of padre talk make for painful reading. The odd thing about the book, however, is that this is obviously not a padre talking. Now and again, a deeper insight and a freer sensibility are allowed to emerge. There are one or two memorable images: ‘… we picture lovers face to face but Friends side by side; their eyes look ahead.’ In this book Lewis is rather like a porpoise; we see its jolly sportings on the surface, and when it goes deeper it disappears from view, but we know that it does have a submarine life.
What is obscure is why Lewis behaves like a porpoise. Partly, perhaps, from a fear of what he sees as spiritual or emotional pretentiousness; partly, I think, with the aim of popularisation. Wishing to put before a wide public his own way to God, he seizes on the robustly commonplace as that in which most may share. Because he is free of contempt for the robustly commonplace, this is in no way dishonest or condescending; but because there is something in him that sees below it, it is quite often uncomfortable. This uncomfortableness, moreover, must tend to defeat his purpose, since on love, of all subjects, writing can carry conviction only if it is born of everything that a man has in him to say about it.2

Discourse on Method, by René Descartes
The fame of Descartes has at least three separate and very firm foundations. In philosophy, it was he who made into the starting point of the philosopher’s inquiry the question, ‘Of what can I be certain,’ and by so doing turned Western philosophy on to a path which in good part it has followed ever since. By asking this question, and by finding as the first and basic answer to it the famous cogito ergo sum—‘I am thinking, therefore I exist’—he did something virtually unthinkable to his predecessors: he made the first certainties of philosophy the immediate data of the individual consciousness, and the main problem of philosophy the sceptical difficulty of how I can ever know that anything except these immediate data exists. Earlier philosophers had taken as the first certainties God, or the world, or some other realm of being outside the individual, and asked how the individual was related to them; Descartes took first the experiences of the individual, and asked how he could go beyond them to knowledge of anything ‘outside.’
The consequences of this revolution have involved, perhaps, as much darkness as light, and many have now come to doubt whether Descartes did ask the right question after all. Nevertheless, it was a step that thought had to take, and a great depth of insight has been gained from seeing where it leads. One extraordinary feature of Descartes’ revolution is that it does seem to have been essentially an individual achievement. Although many elements of his thought are of course less original than he supposed, its central idea seems to have been his alone. Many have supposed themselves to be changing, unaided, the face of philosophy: Descartes really did it.
Second, in mathematics, Descartes has his fame as the founder of analytical geometry. Here his achievement is less startlingly individual. The groundwork was being pursued by his immediate predecessors, and the subject in its present form is said to owe more to the researches, unpublished for many years, of his great contemporary, Fermat. Nevertheless it was he who first clearly brought together algebra and geometry, in a form to produce results of the greatest significance and power.
His third claim to fame is less fundamental but of large historical importance. When in 1637, at the age of forty-one, he produced his first published work, the Discourse on Method, he wrote it in French, in order to reach over the heads of the scholarly readers who expected their philosophy in Latin, and to reach a wider public of men of good sense who, he hoped, would be more open to the voice of pure reason than were the fusty pedants of the Schools. He wrote it in a French which, in the elegance and simplicity it gives to abstract thought, is a wonderful literary achievement. By so doing, he made himself the model for an enduring tradition devoted to the values of a rigorous yet unpedantic clarity. This tradition often collapses into a mythology, and Descartes would no doubt pale at the rationalistic idiocies often praised as examples of l’esprit cartésien; yet the tradition has great achievements to its credit, and not solely in France.
Thus Descartes, literary as well as philosophical and mathematical innovator, has every right to a proud place in any series of Classics. The present selection gives us, besides the Discourse on Method, the Meditations of 1641 and one further text.1 It is a pity, perhaps, that the selection is not rather larger; some extracts from the psychological writings, for instance, would have given a wider view of Descartes’ system. A greater pity, however, is what has happened in this version to Descartes’ style. Descartes should carry one along; here one stumbles over an uneven terrain, tripping over obscurities, omissions, and occasional downright mistranslations. Enough remains for this to be a passable introduction to Descartes’ thought: enough has gone to make at least his third claim to fame, as a philosophical stylist of genius, look rather puzzling.2

The Individual Reason: L’esprit laïc
No era in the history of scientific ideas is more celebrated than the seventeenth century, the century that contains the work of Kepler, of Galileo, of Descartes, and culminates in the publication, in 1687, of Newton’s Principia. The celebration of this great century is just, from more than one point of view. The mere intellectual achievements, individual and cumulative, are gigantic. More than that, the century saw a decisive shift in men’s general outlook, and the firm establishment of what is, to all intents and purposes, the modern attitude towards the physical universe. Besides this, again, the history of these developments, particularly in the first half of the century, is of the greatest dramatic and personal interest, and it is not surprising that the outstanding example of this element, the life of Galileo, should be a recurrent theme of drama and literature, as well as of the history of ideas.
A Conflict over Freedom of Thought?
If we ask what it is about these events that makes them dramatic, we should naturally say that it was a conflict—a conflict between the new science and traditional authority. This conflict tends to present itself as a straightforward conflict over freedom of thought—a fight between those who claimed the right to discover and publish new truths, and those who claimed the right to suppress and silence them. This simple and recognizable picture of the situation we owe, in good part, to the propagandists of the Enlightenment; those who, a century later and in pursuit of definite political and ideological ends, presented the history of these years, as indeed they saw it, in the light of truth versus obscurantism, freedom against power.
There is some truth in this picture. But it is, of course, grossly over-simplified, and its over-simplifications tend to diminish rather than to enhance the dramatic and historical interest of the conflicts of ideas in the seventeenth century. It is only when one looks rather more closely at the kinds of authority that were being rejected, and the kinds of truth, or of ways of truth, that seventeenth-century thinkers sought to put in their place, that one can see the real importance of the century for the history of ideas. The celebrated conflicts were more than a campaign in the struggle for freedom of thought; they concerned the nature of scientific inquiry itself. They raised, in particular, two vital issues. First, what is the relation of scientific inquiry to traditional authority? To this question the century returned a fairly unambiguous answer. Second, what is the relation of scientific inquiry to the common understanding, to the methods of thought of the ordinary inexpert man? To this question it returned a variety of answers, mostly ambiguous and none entirely satisfactory. This latter problem is still essentially with us. It is these two questions—and they are not unrelated to each other—that I should like to pick out from the seventeenth-century picture. In doing this, I shall concentrate mostly on two thinkers, very different in temperament, both from the first half of the century: Galileo and Descartes.
New Approach to the Idea of Authority
First, what about authority? Here we naturally and immediately think of the authority of the Church, both in the sense of power of the Church, its Inquisition and its censorship, and in the sense of theological authority—the claim of the Church, or of certain of its dignitaries, to lay down on supposedly theological grounds what might and might not be believed in natural science. The conflict of the new ideas with this sort of authority is placed firmly in the centre of the historical scene by the case of Galileo. Yet we must not be misled by this case into thinking that the rejection of authority that went with the new ideas was a rejection peculiarly of ecclesiastical authority—this was only one instance of something more general and, from the point of view of the ideas themselves, more important: a new approach to the whole idea of authority in scientific matters. Nor must we suppose that the authority of the Church in general was being called in question: the most that came into question, in relation to scientific ideas, was the use of theological authority to buttress particular cosmological and mechanical theories. Indeed, the general line of the scientists was to say that there was, strictly speaking, no conflict between any of the new scientific ideas and the doctrines of the Church; what was happening was that certain officers of the Church, through malice or confusion, were involving the Church in matters on which it was not theologically required to pronounce.
This line was in some part dictated by prudence; yet it is interesting that Galileo, radical and even provocative though he is in many respects, seems to stick to it. His attitude is well brought out by a note added in his copy of his Dialogues Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, the marvellous book that precipitated his condemnation: ‘Take note, theologians, that in your drive to make matters of faith out of propositions relating to the fixity of sun and earth you run the risk of eventually having to condemn as heretics those who would declare the earth to stand still and the sun to move—at such a time as it might be physically or logically proved that the earth moves and the sun stands still’. In such passages, Galileo’s thought seems to be that when you see that the authority of religion is merely irrelevant to the demonstration of scientific views, you will have the true measure of both religion and science.
Vast Untidy Cocoon
With Descartes, the situation is more complex. Far more cautious than Galileo—‘it is not my temperament’, he once said, ‘to set sail against the wind’—he wraps his true thoughts about the Church in a vast untidy cocoon of concession, deference, and theological argument. Yet it is certain that his Catholic belief was itself genuine, and further, that he did not think, as Galileo seems to have thought, that theology was actually irrelevant to science. On the contrary, in his Principles of Philosophy he himself seeks to derive the basic laws of motion from the properties of God. The derivation is extremely feeble, and the laws in good part mistaken: yet there it is, and something he thought worth doing. But behind this peculiar metaphysical enterprise, so alien to the naturalistic style of Galileo’s argument, there is a deeper similarity between the two. For Descartes’ supposed derivation is a derivation from first principles, from properties of God supposedly self-evident to the reflective mind: it is not a derivation resting on texts, received authorities, or the accumulated interpretations of the ages. This is their great similarity, and the guiding thread through the conflicts with authority: for neither of these two, nor for the other seventeenth-century makers of the new science, was it relevant to a scientific argument to cite or rely on the inherited authority of texts, or the views of distinguished and admired thinkers of the past: you had to look, and think, for yourself. The fact that those who deployed the received texts and appealed to authority were doing so for the most part in an ecclesiastical interest is largely beside the point; the important thing is that it was the method that was wrong, in whatever interest it was being used.
The point is made over and over again, in different connexions: the point that what was said in the past is relevant to scientific inquiry only if it can stand the tests of rigorous inquiry in the present. Thus Descartes in the earliest of his philosophical works, the Rules for the Direction of Understanding, advocates a method for discovering the truth, and characteristically remarks by the way: ‘Neither, though we have mastered all the arguments of Plato and Aristotle, if yet we have not the capacity for passing a solid judgment on these matters, shall we become philosophers; we should have acquired the knowledge, not of a science, but of history’. And in Galileo’s Dialogues, when the scholastic anti-Galilean speaker—characteristically christened by him ‘Simplicio’—cites the authority of Aristotle for some supposed scientific law or experimental result, he is always brought up with the same objection: the authority of Aristotle is only that of any other brilliant and observant man, and the question is, ‘is the law in fact true?’; ‘can the experiments be repeated?’
If, then, a scientific inquiry did not rely, as an historical inquiry must, on the authority of texts; and if the powers of the mind involved in scientific inquiry were not directly those involved in the exegesis of texts, the weighing of authorities, and so on, what were the powers of the mind involved? And who possessed them? What was the seventeenth-century scientists’ picture of the scientist himself?
To these questions there is no simple answer. But one recurrent strain that can be found is the tendency of these thinkers, confronted with prejudice and non-comprehension on the part of the academic vested interests, to turn to ordinary educated men of good sense for an audience and a following. In this respect Galileo and Descartes are alike. Both wrote important works in their native language, instead of the Latin that was still the vehicle of learned communication; both seeking by this to go over the heads of monks and professors to men of good sense in the world of non-academic pursuits. Both of them despised the academic hierarchies, and preferred, on the whole, the company of practical men of affairs, who knew what they were talking about in their own fields. Descartes explains, in the Discourse on Method, how in his youth he took up travelling and moved in the world of courts and armies: ‘It seemed to me that I might meet with much more truth in the reasonings that each man makes on the matters that specially concern him, and the issue of which might very soon punish him if he made a wrong judgment, than in the case of those made by a man of letters in his study touching speculations which lead to no result’. It is notable how many of Descartes’ friends were ambassadors or other men of affairs; indeed it was such men who intervened to help him when he was involved in a protracted and unpleasant dispute with university pedants in Holland.
The Appeal to Good Sense
Certainly Descartes and Galileo seemed to have thought that it was the sort of good sense that was possessed by intelligent men of affairs to which they could appeal with the new scientific reasonings, from which they could hope for understanding. However, were such abilities sufficient to produce scientific reasonings; was the scientist just the man of everyday good sense who applied it in the right way to science? Sometimes Descartes, at least, writes as though it were so; indeed, he goes further. The Discourse on Method famously begins:
Good sense is of all things in the world the most equally distributed, for everybody thinks himself so abundantly provided with it, that even those most difficult to please in all other matters do not commonly desire more of it than they already possess. It is unlikely that this is an error on their part; it seems rather to support the view that the power of distinguishing the true from the false, which is properly speaking what is called Good Sense or Reason, is by nature equal in all men.
He then goes on to say that this being so the reason why some men understand and learn more things than others is that the others do not properly use their natural gifts, but if they are given a method for using these gifts, they may each be as good judges of the truth as others. Such a method, of course, he will propound. This, at any rate, is Descartes’ professed view: the mark of science is the method: this method can be learnt and employed by any man, in the light of the natural reason which all men possess.
It is not clear, however, how far Descartes really believed this. The dry joke about everyone’s satisfaction with his good sense—a well-known saying, incidentally, to be found already in Montaigne—immediately suggests irony; and certainly there is little to be found in Descartes’ own attitude to other researchers which suggests that he thought them of equal ability to himself, only needing acquaintance with the method to set them on the path. Nor, if he did think so, did he exactly go out of his way to help them on to the path; thus he deliberately wrote his Geometry in an obscure style for fear that its originality would not be recognized if he made it too easy, and it gave him special pleasure to think of the difficulty it would give to distinguished French geometers. It is not unfair to say that Descartes’ general attitude to science was that it was a business for geniuses, and that there were, at least, very few of them besides himself.
No Feeling of Scientific Community
The self-absorption which is very noticeable in Descartes, the lack of interest in the scientific efforts of others, is not peculiar to him; on the contrary, the absence of a sense of a scientific community is characteristic of the earlier seventeenth century. In part, it was due to lack of communications: the institutions designed to further communication, such as the Royal Society in this country, are the product of the sixteen-sixties and later. But this is not the only reason; even when the channels existed, the messages were often ignored. Thus Galileo, having been sent Kepler’s book, left it unread—disastrously, if not (in this case) altogether surprisingly. Descartes, again, was sent some important work of Galileo by the Abbé Mersenne, whose indefatigable scientific correspondence made him almost a single-handed Royal Society; ‘I have no time to read Galileo’, Descartes loftily replied. There is a deeper reason than lack of communications here. It is that in the first part of the century the men in the front of the new advance tended fantastically to under-estimate the size of the scientific task before them, and were able to believe that in outline at least the shape of all scientific explanations might be discovered by one man of genius, or a few, in their own lifetimes. Granted this, it is not surprising that they should have not carried very far any belief which they had, that science was really only the methodical application of the good sense which was latent in the common understanding. Genius, or a genius, was enough.
Nevertheless, in their rejection of the academic professionals which I have already mentioned, there did arise the notion that it was some sort of unprofessional good sense or natural light of reason that, given the right method, could discover the truth. Nowhere do we find this element more pronounced than in the writings of Galileo’s English contemporary, Francis Bacon. He was much inferior in scientific and philosophical powers to Galileo and the other leaders of thought—‘he writes philosophy like a Lord Chancellor’, William Harvey tartly said of him; but he busied himself in projects for the spread and utilization of science, which, precisely perhaps because of his lack of scientific genius, bring the subject nearer to the worlds of politics, committees, and economic organization. Bacon did indeed believe that there was a scientific method which anyone of moderate good sense could employ; and though he, too, tended to share the illusion that the main scientific discoveries would be made very quickly, he did have a view of the scientific process which would allow of an indefinitely prolonged effort by the combined activities of sensible men who had been properly trained. His views have correspondingly had a wide appeal at different times to societies in which these qualities were at a premium; as the American scholar C. C. Gillispie has admirably put it in his recent book, The Edge of Objectivity:
Baconianism has always held a special appeal as the way of science in societies which develop a vocation for the betterment of man’s estate, and which confide not in aristocracies whether of birth or brains, but in a wisdom to be elicited from common pursuits—in seventeenth-century England, in eighteenth-century France, in nineteenth-century America, amongst Marxists of all countries.
Two Attitudes to the Scientist
Thus in the rise of modern scientific method at the beginning of the seventeenth century, and its displacement of appeals to authority in such matters, we find lurking two different attitudes to the scientist himself. On the one hand, there is the natural emphasis on the genius who invented the method, or at least applied it with conspicuous brilliance and success, and who may hope to apply it to all principal problems in his lifetime. On the other hand, there is the notion of a common understanding between men of good sense uncorrupted by traditional learning, to which the genius may appeal as an audience of his discoveries, and who may, once the method has been discovered, be able to apply it and carry on the business of scientific inquiry by a suitable division of labour. Neither of these attitudes contained the truth about science: it is not to the point here to examine the relations of the scientific genius to the vast body of scientists who are not geniuses; it is enough to say, contrary to both the Baconian and the genius-centred views, that both of these types are needed.
There is one feature of this situation, however, that demands a final word. In the adjustment over the last three centuries of what might be called the genius element and the journeyman element in the scientific process, one set of people who have tended to be excluded are those that are neither geniuses nor journeymen scientists: those non-scientific men of good sense, whom Galileo and Descartes had in mind, seem to have become scientists themselves, and have had their good sense suitably trained, or to remain non-scientific and find their good sense not adequate to understanding what is going on. The plain man seems once more, by a characteristic historical circle, to be set against authority, only this time the authority is that of the scientist: whether he is regarded as the genius whose processes of thought are beyond ordinary reach, or as the journeyman who, even if his talents are not much stronger than the plain man’s, has had a formal professional training in techniques of thought and inquiry which are incomprehensible to the untrained mind, however good its sense.
For a plain man who suffers from this well-known feeling of exclusion from the world of natural science, a look at the history of scientific ideas in the seventeenth century can be most rewarding. For one thing, it can actually remove some of the grounds of the feeling: to see men of genius painfully constructing ideas which are now commonplace, in order to solve problems which are now, thanks to their efforts, simple, is to learn in fact a good deal about the processes of scientific thought. But even if it did not cure his present sense of exclusion, a visit to those years would fortify, retrospectively, as it were, his plain man’s self-respect. For at some points in the seventeenth century, if he were lucky enough to be at the right place at the right time, he could for a short while see the world of scientific discovery clearly with his own eyes, under a brilliant sky in which the clouds of traditional authority had dispersed and the clouds of expert authority had not yet gathered.
What Is Existentialism?
It is not easy to explain Existentialism, for two reasons. First, it is by any standards an obscure philosophy, whose exponents tend to express themselves in a very dark style. Second, there is a great variety of thinkers who might be called in the broadest sense ‘existentialists’, but whose views are very different one from another—some are Marxists, some liberals; some are atheists, and others Christians. Not all of those often called ‘Existentialists’ will accept the title.
Nevertheless, some threads run through this range of thought. To pick up the threads, it is probably best to look at the historical influences that have produced Existentialism. Of these, the most important is perhaps the nineteenth-century Danish thinker, Søren Kierkegaard. Kierkegaard was a deeply religious man, dominated by the idea—an extreme Protestant idea—of man’s inadequacy in the face of God. In particular, he rejected with great vehemence and impressive intensity the philosophy then dominant in Europe, the philosophy of Hegel. Hegel’s system he regarded as abstract, intellectual, inhuman, and as offering false comforts: it tried to absorb man and his individual experience into a generalised picture of the world, and this concealed what Kierkegaard saw as a gulf between men and the world, and between men and God, which could only be bridged by an act of faith, a leap in the dark, which had to be taken in ‘fear and trembling’. To lose oneself in the generalised notions of an academic system like Hegel’s was to evade reality and responsibility.
This letter has been included as a reminder of the extraordinary work of the BBC World Service in more generous times.
A certain influence from Kierkegaard can be found in all existentialists, even those who, unlike him, are atheists. Among such existentialists, the best-known is the contemporary French philosopher, playwright, and novelist, Jean-Paul Sartre; his views are largely shared by his friend, the woman writer Simone de Beauvoir. Sartre’s central view is that ‘man has no essence’—that there is nothing that he has to be, no fixed pattern laid down for him to follow. The basic fact about man is just that he exists: hence the name ‘existentialist’. He exists, moreover, as a conscious being, someone who can be aware of what he is doing—aware, moreover, of this fact that there is no fixed pattern laid down for him, no values given to him from outside. This awareness gives man freedom to choose: and he has to choose, to commit himself, to certain values, and a certain way of life. This choice is, however, arbitrary: there is nothing to show a man how he must choose, but choose he must. Hence the despair or anxiety which writers like Sartre find at the bottom of things—it comes from the fact that man must choose, when his choice must in the end be arbitrary. Man must make his own values—out of nothing. There are indeed according to Sartre some people who attempt to conceal this state of affairs from themselves, by persuading themselves that some way of life or system of values is absolute, dictated by the world: but this is an illusion, and such people are merely trying to deny their freedom. They are, in Sartre’s phrase, ‘in bad faith’.
Existentialism is essentially concerned with problems of choice and personal commitment; and it is indeed one of its beliefs that it is only through direct personal living, the agencies of real choice, that anything can really be understood. Not surprisingly therefore writers like Sartre express their outlook as much through plays and novels as through formal works of philosophy, though Sartre and others also write such works.
Existentialism is a movement largely centred in France and Germany, and has very little influence in Great Britain. This is in part because the more philosophical or theoretical parts of Existentialism belong to a tradition of obscure metaphysical writing, having its origins in Germany, which has never appealed to the more pragmatic and literal-minded British thinkers. The most obscure of Existentialist thinkers, the German Martin Heidegger, would be thought by most British critics to be often writing what is quite literally nonsense. The more dramatic parts of Existentialism, on the other hand, its emphasis on the terrors of moral choice and the absence of any absolute principles of life, while they have relevance everywhere, naturally strike home hardest in countries where the political structure has in the recent past disintegrated or been overthrown. The French interest in Existentialism arose in the first place chiefly from the moral problems of the Resistance to the Germans in Occupied France.
These dramatic and personal aspects of Existentialism are probably of greater significance than its metaphysical theories. Even though Sartre and others have produced some important theoretical ideas, the main body of Existentialist theory is likely to appear to the future as a special and extreme type of German Romantic metaphysics rather than as a central contribution to the history of philosophy. The notion of ‘existential living’, however, with its emphasis on commitment, has certainly had a considerable impact on many people’s thoughts about values, and on their actions, and may continue to do so.
Sketch for a Theory of the Emotions, by Jean-Paul Sartre
This is a translation of a brief work that was published in 1939, and it is an excellent thing that it has appeared.1 It is of considerable interest in its own right, and also serves as a comparatively luminous introduction to some of the themes which Sartre pursues more portentously in Being and Nothingness. Not all readers may entirely agree with the blurb when it says that the essay ‘is nowhere an obscure or difficult work,’ but it is true that it has a special briskness and lightness of touch.
Sartre starts by criticising three existing theories of emotion—a ‘theory of emotion’ being a theory about what emotions essentially are, of what distinguishes them from other psychological happenings. The theories criticised are those of William James, that an emotion consists of consciousness of an internal physiological disturbance; of Pierre Janet, that emotion is ‘the behaviour of defeat’; and of certain Gestalt psychologists, that emotion (the example particularly considered is anger) is an escape from tension experienced in trying to ‘structure’ a recalcitrant environment. Of these theories, Sartre regards the third as better than the second, and the second as better than the first; we are approaching, without reaching the truth.
He then turns to criticism of psychoanalytic theories, the point of attack being the concept of the unconscious; this is a theme he has developed in later writings. From this, he moves to his own theory, which occupies the last forty or so pages of the book. The central idea of this is that emotion is a more primitive state of consciousness or way of seeing the world, the essence of which is that it embodies a belief in magic. The object of a fear, for instance, may be seen as horrible quite independently of any powers for harm it may be believed to have; the fact that the horrible face at the window is on the other side of the window just disappears in the state of terror.
More basically, the magical element occurs in the reactions of the man in the emotion; in fear we may faint, and this is a magical way of seeking to annihilate the object of fear—like a man faced with a difficult problem who just goes to sleep. The account is not supposed to apply only to negative emotions; with great ingenuity, Sartre applies the same ideas to joy, for instance, which he identifies as a magical way of trying to make simultaneous and complete satisfactions incomplete and successive.
As so often with Sartre, I find myself left at the end dazzled but doubtful. The cleverness and imagination are enormous, and sometimes one is convinced. But even where one is, there is a doubt about what one has been convinced of. This doubt goes back to Sartre’s method, the so-called ‘phenomenological’ method, which he took (with adaptations) from Husserl. The philosophy of this method is complex and not easy to make clear. Mrs. Mary Warnock, in a brief but helpful preface to this book, goes some way to making it clear, though I wonder whether—despite her disclaimers—she has not overestimated the genuine influence of Descartes on Sartre. For Descartes, mind or consciousness is something to be investigated independently of the world, by way of reflexion. With Sartre, for whom it is essential that consciousness does not have to be reflexive, that we can experience without thinking that we experience, we discover the activities of consciousness by giving a description of the world as it appears to consciousness: the activities of mind are, as it were, ‘read back’ from the world as it seems in different states of mind.
There are two great difficulties with this method. One is that the ‘activities’ of mind which are posited seem so often to be fictional; in Sartre all the time we are doing things—and, in one sense, consciously doing things—of which we are not aware. The other difficulty lies in evaluating the descriptions of the world as it seems. The world of, say, a frightened man may be described in many ways; is there any method of deciding which description is, for the purposes of this philosophy, the best, the one that gets nearest to the essence of fear? We may be able to get no further than seeing that some descriptions ‘come off’ and others do not. At any rate, some of Sartre’s do most resoundingly come off.2

Sense and Sensibilia and Philosophical Papers, by J. L. Austin
Sense and Sensibilia consists of a course of lectures that Austin gave for several years, mostly skilfully stitched together from the notes by Mr Warnock.1 It is a remarkable book: original, clear, forceful, entertaining and salutary. It is bound to have, as Austin’s personal influence had, a considerable effect on the terms of philosophical discussion. After it, the philosophy of perception cannot be discussed in ways it usually was discussed before.
It is one of the peculiarities of philosophy, however, that the influence and genuine importance of a philosophical work can be remarkably independent of its actual success in doing what, in the narrower terms of its thesis and argument, it sets out to do. In the case of Sense and Sensibilia, it is not easy to determine just what it does set out to do; but of various aims that might plausibly be ascribed to it, only one really comes off. This is the aim, which serves as a thread running through the book, of showing that certain of the arguments used by Ayer in The Foundations of Empirical Knowledge do not work. Austin’s more important criticisms of these arguments are very effective; in particular he brings out, very briefly and clearly, an important circularity in Ayer’s approach (p. 60).
But Austin’s purpose, of course, was not just to criticise Ayer: he did not merely want to give, in lectures year after year, a hostile review of certain passages in a twenty-year-old book. A wider purpose, it seems, was to destroy a thesis of which Ayer’s book was one expression: the thesis that there are certain objects called ‘sense-data’, which we perceive in a way more direct or immediate than that in which we perceive tables, chairs, and so forth. This more general aim of refutation, if he really had it, Austin cannot be said to have accomplished. For one thing, he explicitly leaves out of consideration one important type of argument for sense-data, used by Ayer, and also by Price, whose book Perception is occasionally referred to: an argument from the causal conditions of perception (cf. p. 46, note 2). For another thing, he blandly ignores certain difficulties on which some philosophers (notably Moore) put a lot of weight in arguing for sense-data. We speak of seeing a star, and also of seeing a silvery speck; this silvery speck is one sort of thing that people have wanted to call ‘a sense-datum’. But, Austin asks, ‘wouldn’t we be prepared to say, and quite correct in saying, that the silvery speck is a star?’ (p. 92). Isn’t it just like kicking a piece of painted wood, and kicking Jones’ door (p. 98); or like seeing Hitler, and seeing a man in black trousers (p. 99)? Answer: no; for the reason that Austin himself gives us, undisturbedly, in discussing another example (p. 98, note)—that though I may say ‘that white dot on the horizon is my house’, this does not license the conclusion that I live in a white dot. But if I live behind Jones’ door, I live behind that piece of wood, and if (alarmingly) I lived with Hitler, I lived with that man in black trousers. That is to say, the analogies supposed to show simple identity here do not work; and it is precisely this fact that has inspired an important sort of talk about sense-data. Sense-data are, in fact, a pretty dead duck by now; but if the duck has any life in it, Austin’s arguments are not enough to finish it off.
However, this may not matter so much. Perhaps, after all, his concern with the sense-datum theorists is only incidental. He has a still more general aim: to illustrate how philosophers tend to obliterate important distinctions, to ignore the diversity of the facts, and to take little notice of how our language actually works. For this aim, the examples of some arguments about sense-data will do. Austin repeatedly claims that these arguments fail because they ignore the vast variety of relevant situations, and also the distinctions between many different linguistic expressions, and uses of the same expression, that apply to those situations. Now it seems to be Austin’s thesis that the first of these neglects is in some way due to the second: that the crude Gleichschaltung of importantly different situations has been caused by philosophers’ neglecting subtle distinctions in the ordinary use of language. Part of the general aim of the book might be taken to be that of showing this connection.
If so, it is once more very doubtful whether Austin succeeds. His own practice does not do much to bear out the connection. For instance, Austin points out that Ayer and others have tended to use ‘material object’ merely as a foil to ‘sense-datum’, and have implied that anything that (roughly) is publicly perceptible is a material object. This he rightly criticizes—not, however, by talking about the uses of ‘material’, or of ‘perceive’, but by just reminding us of how many sorts of things we can see, hear, etc. Conversely Austin does some subtle work of distinguishing uses of ‘looks’, ‘seems’ and ‘appears’ in their various constructions, displaying in this the fine linguistic ear which was one of his outstanding gifts. But this set of distinctions is not at all closely tied into the argument; in particular, he does not show at all how neglect of them has misled the sense-datum theorists. It would be odd, prima facie, if, for some of these usages, he could do so, since they have nothing specially to do with perception at all.
In general, it is remarkable how little Austin uses his methods of close linguistic observation to support the specifically philosophical points that he makes, such as his claims that there are no incorrigible statements, and that there is no intrinsic relation between two statements which is that of one’s being evidence for the other. Correspondingly, the linguistic observations seem often to be pursued for their own sake. This impression is borne out by various pieces in the Philosophical Papers, in which Messrs Urmson and Warnock have assembled all Austin’s published, and three unpublished, papers.2 Moreover, there are in this book some pointers to why this detachment of philosophy and linguistic study should occur: there is a good deal to suggest that Austin actively wanted in his linguistic studies, to get away from philosophical problems. This, then, is why the sense-datum theorists get such incomplete treatment; Austin’s aim was to remove, not so much belief in their answers, as interest in their questions.
There was, however, to be a way back to philosophy. The linguistic study would lead back eventually to the subjects which the philosophical theorists had over-rapidly attacked—it was to be, in a famous phrase, the ‘begin-all’. How was the ‘begin-all’ to be pursued? Austin’s answer to this seems to have been a Baconian one: that one patiently assembled distinctions in ordinary use, and then elicited from them a pattern or theory—perhaps at that stage, but only at that stage, introducing some technical terms of one’s own. The trouble about this is, that if it is taken literally, it is just impossible. There is no classification without a purpose—in theoretical matters, without a theory or a problem. Without some preexisting notion of what one wants the distinctions for, their number is entirely indeterminate: one can go on making as many as one likes. Sometimes, indeed, Austin seems just to be making some distinctions which take his fancy. Often, however, Austin in fact had a firm idea at the beginning what he wanted the distinctions to do, and assembled them accordingly; and because he was a man of great philosophical insight, the assembly is often illuminating. Without the insight, the same activity is boring and pointless; he had not discovered, any more than Bacon had, a method that could be handed over to mechanics to churn out results.
Apart from the way in which the activity was to be conducted, what was the point of it? Why all this close scrutiny of ordinary uses? Here we meet a curious view of Austin’s, which might be called his ‘Wisdom of the Ages’ thesis: that our ordinary speech contains a battery of distinctions that men have found useful through the centuries, and which have stood the test of time, and that these are likely to be sounder than any which a theorist can—at least when in a hurry—think up. There is a strong prima facie case for thinking that our ordinary working distinctions are very good anyway; and if we are to improve on them—as it is possible that we might, in some cases—we have at the very least to discover what they are first (cf. Sense and Sensibilia, p. 63; Papers, p. 133 et al.).
This view, of course, already presupposes some substantial positions about the nature of philosophy, to the effect that a certain kind of speculative philosophy, the kind that tried to show that men were quite mistaken about some fundamental features of the world, is impossible. If all these distinctions had been elaborated under a gigantic misapprehension, there could scarcely be much point in studying them. Thus the view takes for granted a whole lot of arguments right from the beginning. But since it shares this presupposition with most views at the present time, and with many at others, and since (to put it mildly) it is a presupposition for which there is something to be said, this is not the most interesting point about Austin’s view. A more interesting question is that of its conservatism, even within the range of philosophy that is not enormously speculative. Now the charge that Austin was a linguistic conservative has been made, and has been rebutted by reminding us that the study of existing uses was indeed a ‘begin-all’—after the investigation, then possibly reform. But this is still, in fact, conservatism. It is particularly so if conjoined with the Baconian thesis about the methods of investigation, for on that thesis, the investigation will be literally interminable. Even without that, it is conservative. It amounts to the proposal that no revolution or even reform can be mounted without a thorough sociological investigation of the ancien régime; and this is a proposal which in other contexts is rightly regarded as amounting to the proposal that there be no reform.
If Austin’s advice had prevailed in the past, there would have been very little philosophy. This, perhaps, he would not have deplored. But there is a further question: if these Burkean counsels had been followed, would we now have a good number of the distinctions and usages that we do have in ordinary language? For who was it who laid down this intricate web of linguistic institutions? Austin writes vaguely of ‘the inherited experience and acumen of many generations of men … [in] the practical business of life’ (Papers, p. 133). But don’t we need some real historical material about the changes in language? Above all, about the repeated impact on it, particularly in the fields Austin was most concerned with, of the despised hasty theorists? In language, as in politics, the conservative runs into the fact that the old is only what used to be new.
There are other ways in which Austin’s attitude to language seems historically unrealistic. Sometimes his respect for the old seems to cloud his natural appreciation of the realities and vaguenesses of lexicography, and his tone reminds one almost of another Burke, that of the Peerage; as when he writes of ‘our vast and, for the most part, relatively ancient stock of ordinary words’ (Sense and Sensibilia, p. 63: my italics). What is the antiquity of a word? How ancient, for example, is the word ‘idea’?
I suspect that the Wisdom of the Ages thesis is in fact a myth, a fanciful picture of the past designed to justify certain activities in the present. Austin was fascinated by, and extraordinarily gifted in detecting, nuances of ordinary speech. He also had great philosophical imagination and acumen. He sought to bring the two together, by urging the study of ordinary use as the method of philosophy, or at least a method necessarily preliminary to philosophy. At the theoretical level, I do think he succeeded. In his practice, it is notable that he often scarcely tried. When he did try, and succeeded, it was above all at the level of persuasion, in his extremely skilful deployment of fine linguistic distinctions as a weapon to encourage—or, more characteristically, to discourage—the holding of certain philosophical beliefs.
In this use of philosophical dissuasion, there is an obvious parallel with the later Wittgenstein. Neither had any faith in the older aspirations to philosophical proof; both urged patience and the recognition of untidy complexities; both substituted for older styles a persuasive method that was more effective in their own hands than it is (at least in a pure form) in the hands of others. They were, however, at completely opposite ends of the psychological spectrum in philosophy. The aim of Wittgenstein’s method was illumination; its highest term of commendation, ‘depth’; its fault, allusive obscurity. Austin—who carried to really remarkable lengths the English dislike of pretentiousness—sought plain truth; by way of accuracy; and the danger was pedantry. To which of these ways one is more attracted must be a question of temperament. But it must be said—as Popper rightly insists—that no branch of human thought has ever advanced by making its watchword just the accumulation of as many truths as possible, accurately expressed. These two remarkable books would not be as interesting and valuable if Austin had taken himself, as he insisted on taking other philosophers, literally.

The Concept of a Person, by A. J. Ayer
This book of essays (four new and five reprinted) gives a very good view of Professor Ayer’s present philosophical situation, which is an interesting one.1 It is now a long time since he gave up any large-scale adherence to the logical positivism that he originally expounded in that dazzling book, Language, Truth, and Logic, but he retains a loyalty to certain features of positivism. This can take the form of a nostalgic attachment to specific doctrines, and then it tends to have a Quixotic ring. In the first of these papers, which was his inaugural lecture at Oxford given in 1960, he says ‘for my part I have no wish to disown the verification principle, though it suffers from a vagueness which it has not yet been found possible to eradicate’; and this indeed is pure loyalty, since it is a long time since anyone, including Ayer, has worked to improve the verification principle, and it is obvious, from this paper itself and also from others in the book, that he is no longer interested in it.
These infrequent gestures towards the Clause Four of his philosophy are unimportant. What is important, and very stimulating, is his adherence to something else: a general temper of philosophical argument which he showed in his positivist period, and which is not that most frequently met with today. Although positivism did, in an untypical way, have this tone, it belongs most typically to a philosopher who has never been a positivist, Bertrand Russell. The literary style of this book—which contains some of the best of Ayer’s excellent writing—often reminds one of Russell, though with less surface brilliance, fewer jokes, and a greater devotion to painstaking argument. There are also beliefs that he shares with Russell: for instance, that philosophical conclusions can be straightforwardly (well, fairly straightforwardly) true or false, and can be shown to be so by argument; and that it is appropriate to speak of those conclusions that have not yet been shown to be true or false as though they were hypotheses, probable or improbable, well or ill-supported.
These are not the most prevalent beliefs in philosophy today; the ways of speaking that go with them cause many philosophers discomfort. The two thinkers who have most influenced British philosophy in the last 15 years, Wittgenstein and J. L. Austin, both did a lot, in different ways, to bring this about. Wittgenstein, though entirely involved in philosophy, doubted whether it could offer truths; Austin, in pursuit of truths, doubted whether they were to be found in philosophy. Wittgenstein developed an informal but very powerful style of reflection which sought insight into the origins of philosophical problems; Austin, up to his untimely death in 1960, devoted himself in good part to the accurate study of certain linguistic expressions in common use, hoping, it seems, by these means to by-pass traditional centres of philosophical argument and confusion.
Ayer is evidently sceptical about both these influences; and the interest of his situation is that, Wittgenstein and Austin having gone, he finds himself, at the height of his powers, sustaining philosophical methods that both of them had known very well, and had rejected. With Austin, there is perhaps no very great difficulty: his considerable, though unfinished, contribution is something that one can to some extent take or leave, and Ayer leaves most of it. With Wittgenstein, the problem is harder. His impact, both on the spirit of philosophy and on some particular issues, was enormous, and cannot be ignored. The problem, of the departed genius who has apparently dissolved one’s own idiom, is just there—Ayer is the Brahms to Wittgenstein’s Wagner.
The most superficial difficulty about this situation is that one may appear to the modish a bit old-fashioned. Ayer does not mind this at all, but on the contrary enjoys it; his enthusiasm for shocking the establishment (another resemblance to Russell) has merely found a newer object. (This enthusiasm has indeed led him, in this book, to make a curious slip: in the paper called ‘Names and Descriptions’ he criticises, from a Russellian point of view, what he calls ‘a fashionable theory of reference’, which, although it has been recently favoured, in fact belongs essentially to Frege, and is older than Russell’s.) However, an enthusiastic refusal to succumb cannot be enough by itself; it needs substantial backing.
Ayer provides backing; his methods justify themselves, if not always to the same extent. Some of the pieces treat topics over which Wittgenstein’s shadow falls less densely, and most of these are a great success; the ones on probability, laws of nature, and fatalism, for instance, are splendid examples of clear, straightforward and powerful argument. Elsewhere, as in the title piece and one called ‘Can there be a Private Language?’, he is nearer to Wittgenstein’s main topics and his influence, and here I find that although the same virtues are often displayed, the outcome is less satisfactory. There is one particularly important reason for this. Ayer is still very attached to what was a thesis of positivism, and before that, of Hume, that any connection between two propositions or states of affairs must be either purely logical, a matter of meaning and definition, or else merely contingent, a matter of fact. Wittgenstein in effect rejected this axiom: the connection, for instance, between a feeling and its overt expression he regarded as neither of these (and not ‘synthetic a priori’, either). Now it is certainly true that his views on this have never been clearly formulated. But too much of what he says, it seems to me, is illuminating for one to suppose that there is nothing there at all, that it is all a big mistake. Whatever it is that is in the shadow, Ayer has not finally come to grips with it.
His failure to do so, however, is not an evasion. For what is particularly impressive about this book is its honesty. Even when Ayer hurries, as he sometimes does, he is not hurrying by on the other side. In the self-conscious commitment to his methods, there is nothing fake or fudged or done merely for effect. In this also, as in historical position—if in nothing else whatsoever—Ayer is like Brahms.

Two Faces of Science
What are the two faces of science? At one level, it is just that we have a notion of science as technological power, which is by its very nature ambiguous, and which can be used, as preachers and others remind us every day, for good or for ill—bacteriological research for saving life or for germ warfare, nuclear energy for power-stations or for bombs. This is the most familiar form of the conflict between two aspects of science—the contrast between good and evil uses of technology. But although it is the most familiar form, I am sure it is not the only one, and fairly sure that it is not the most fundamental. Because, first of all, one certainly has not given an adequate account of the fear that many people have of technological progress if one just points out that technological discoveries can have evil uses. What may frighten them more deeply, in a way, is not so much the evil uses of technology as the evil consequences of its good uses; for we all know that we ought to be avoiding the evil uses, but of course are only too happy to pursue the good uses, with the alarming consequences they may entail: consequences which in the popular imagination may run all the way from the relatively immediate problems of unemployment due to automation, through to pictures of a future society in which we may be able to live indefinitely, construct in advance a genetic programme for our children, and educate them by direct causal action on their brains: all with results that we are afraid to dream about.
But even when one has added in these elements, I still do not think one has fully expressed the conflict between the light and the dark sides of our latent idea of science. For all this is still concerned with science as a means; it is concerned with science as technology. But I do not think that on either side, the positive or the negative, can the conflict be put as simply as this implies. For, on the one hand, there is certainly a prestige, an excitement, a cultural and intellectual value, which is thought, and rightly thought, to attach to science independently of its technological output. And on the negative side there is the point that this very excitement and human satisfaction involved in the scientific process can undermine the simple relations of means and ends; it can bring it about that we never find ourselves just in the situation of being able to decide how or whether to use certain scientific means. There is the fear, at least, that inherent in the impetus of scientific advance itself is a certain necessity that those means which are possible will be discovered, and those means that have been discovered will be used.
But let us go back to the positive side. There is in present society a genuine cultural enthusiasm for the idea of science itself, and in particular for the pure sciences. Why this is so is a complex question, involving, among other things, the economic basis of modern society, and its effects on people’s attitudes. But why it ought to be so seems to me, on the other hand, a very easy question to answer, at least if you are prepared, as I am, to answer it in an unabashed high-minded way: it is because the achievements of the natural sciences represent in our age the highest intellectual and imaginative achievements of man, that is to say our highest cultural achievements.
As soon as I use the word ‘cultural’ like that, there are people who, like Hermann Goering, reach for their gun; and we immediately find ourselves in the now desolated intellectual no-man’s land of the so-called ‘two cultures’. I am not going to attempt the discouraging task of putting together the ruins that litter the ground there. But since this is a personal view, let me dogmatically state a position. Sir Charles Snow was quite right, in my view, to draw attention, as Lord Russell and others had done before him, to a certain anomaly in our intellectual life. One is not generally regarded in intellectual circles as an educated or cultivated person unless one has, for instance, some conception of what the Middle Ages or the Renaissance stand for, or of what was done by Dante, or Titian, or Goethe, or Beethoven; and so too, for contemporary artists. But it is not in the same way always regarded as an occasion for cultivated embarrassment if ignorance is shown, or even declared, of the achievements of Galileo, or Newton, or Mendel, or (in the present time) of relativity theory or molecular biology. This state of affairs is certainly absurd: absurd for more than one reason.
The Enemy of Parochialism
I take it that a chief aim of culture and education of any kind is to be the enemy of parochialism: that by knowledge both of fact in general and of man’s achievements at other times and in other places one can form a juster assessment of one’s own place and the place of one’s society in the scheme of things. These general considerations about any sort of culture evidently apply to science, both in respect of the history of science and of certain present conclusions, theories, and also methods, of the sciences. The history is important, as part of what man has achieved; the present state is important, because parochialism will hardly have been resisted, if while one has some general conception of how one’s society has evolved from other societies, as may be taught by the humane discipline of history, one nevertheless has no conception, or at least no living and effective conception, of how man himself evolved, for instance, or of the place of his planet in the universe.
But this is not the only point: for there is another sense of ‘culture’ in which to speak of a common culture is to speak of men sympathizing in and sharing some common aim, and living in an environment which is commonly understood. And whatever the difficulties of such conceptions in modern society, it is certain that men cannot fare well if they are cut off from an understanding of the methods and results of those activities that provide the central achievements of their time; or even, to go to a lower level, if they cannot comprehend, at least in outline, the nature and workings of the mere mechanical devices with which they are surrounded. They will be living in an alien world.
To these sorts of arguments—and they are familiar enough—it is often replied that there just is a barrier against understanding; that those not formally educated in the natural sciences can never attain to anything but superficial misunderstanding of them, and that this is on intellectual grounds disreputable, and worse than useless. The merit of this reply seems to me to depend on who advances it. If a specialist in one branch of science condemns as superficial the understanding of that branch by a non-expert, I will sympathize with him; for one knows that any expert in anything will inevitably so regard non-expert understanding, and, within his frame of reference, rightly so. But this point, of course, applies as much to relations between different scientists as it does to those between scientists and others. We have got into the habit of talking about ‘science’ as though it were one big thing that you are either inside or out of, but this is a mistake: there are sciences, and branches of the same science, and experts in one may have at most nodding acquaintance with the work in others. Yet scientists in different disciplines, unless themselves very narrow men, do think it worth while to have a little understanding of other scientists’ work. So why not others? When the objection—nowadays usually put in the tempting form ‘it is an insult to science to treat it superficially’—is advanced by non-scientists, it has all the characteristics of a psychological defence-mechanism. For they are demanding in this case what they do not demand in any other: expert knowledge, or no knowledge at all. But in no other cultural field whatsoever is such a ridiculous demand made. The knowledge that most of us have of the Middle Ages would be regarded as shallow and inadequate by an undergraduate specializing in that period; our knowledge of the history of art, by an art-historian; of music, by a musicologist: yet those bits of knowledge, giving us some general sense of how things go in those areas, are worth having.
But I do not accept the ‘two cultures’ formulation, and in particular I do not accept that the issue is at all just about those who have had some sort of scientific training versus those who have not. For in the sense that I care about the cultural significance of scientific achievement, a feeling for this may be as effectively lacking in those who have had scientific training as in those who have not. I have myself talked to groups of students in the sciences, both in technology and in the pure sciences, and been alarmed by the lack, in some of them, of any such feeling. Competent technically, they had no feeling for the history, role, or basic nature of their activities; science as one great human activity and achievement among others—for this is what it is—meant little to them.
Nor is this entirely confined to students; nor—and this is actually more dangerous—does this lack of understanding only take the form of having no views on the human significance of scientific and technological processes. There are some people—and I must emphasize, in case it is not already totally obvious, that I mean only a very few among the scientists and technologists I have met—who do have a set of very passionate views on such issues; views, however, which are not illuminated by any general understanding of historical or social matters, and which these people falsely think can be supported from science itself. These views come roughly to saying that technological progress is all; that a tough-minded utilitarianism is the only acceptable social philosophy; that there cannot be any free will and hence, it is supposed, present conceptions of justice and so forth are archaic, and to be replaced by techniques of social control. And occasionally, in their headier moments, they add that since only technologists understand these matters and are free from archaic illusions, they ought to have a much larger say in what happens. This set of views, just put baldly like that, is a caricature; but in a few cases at least the caricature comes uncomfortably close to the truth. And what is certain is that such a caricature plays a role in what I called earlier the negative aspect of our latent idea of science; this is one thing that frightens, when we think about a certain impetus in technological advance itself to produce an inhuman world.
Though it is a familiar point, it cannot be said too often that the sorts of views I have just caricatured, whatever merits they may or may not have, are in no sense whatsoever part or consequences of any natural science or technological application of it, and to suppose that they are is not only a philosophical mistake but grossly unscientific as well. To make it clear that science by itself cannot give us the clue to the social future is one task of those who educate scientists; just as it is a task for those who educate the others to make it clear that without some knowledge and sympathy with the sciences no one will understand the social future, or the past or present either. I do not think that these educational tasks need be quite as difficult as many people have been making out. Looking more closely at the ambiguous face of science, it is not so hard to see how it is in the highest sense one among human activities.
The English Moralists, by Basil Willey
This book has emerged from a course of lectures which the author gave, as he rather dauntingly informs us in the Preface, for more than thirty years in the University of Cambridge.1 The course of lectures and the examination paper that it serves were conceived at a time—as Willey mentions—when the remnants of a pure aestheticism made it less than fashionable to attempt to relate literature and morality. They continued—though this he does not mention—through a period when his colleague in Cambridge, F. R. Leavis, was indeed relating literature to morality, but in a way that still gave little scope to the reflective history of moral ideas: the morality to which Leavis relates literature is a morality, a particular kind of outlook which, being identified with the essence of creative literary sensibility itself, becomes the basis of a peculiarly timeless kind of criticism.
Thus Willey, in more than one climate of opinion, has kept alive the connections between the study of English literature and the history of ideas. From his efforts there has come a string of sturdy and not unworthy books: the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Century Backgrounds, the Nineteenth Century Studies. They, too, got some of their matter from this persistent course of lectures, and the lecture-room tone, it must be said, is often present in their helpful summaries of reported writers. Now, in the year of his retirement from the King Edward VII Chair of English Literature, Willey has cleaned up the rest of his accumulated notes and published them as The English Moralists, both as a memorial of the years’ activities, and with the hope (typical of a certain Cambridge introversion) that the book may help his successors, “if only as a historical atlas or as an awful warning,” in guiding the future course of these same lectures.
It would be ungracious of Willey’s successors, whoever they may be, to take him up too peremptorily on the second, at least, of these preferred interpretations. Yet perhaps it will be better if they do. There is, very obviously, no recipe for valuable writing in the history of ideas, no substantial maxims to make sure that what is written will be helpful or illuminating. But there are at least a few crude necessary conditions that one may look for, such as accuracy (to a reasonable degree) and absence of prejudice (of an unreasonable sort), and these conditions Willey satisfies only intermittently. This is because there are two substantial matters which, in quite different ways, he has not got under control: philosophy and Christianity.
Philosophy he puts down right at the beginning with some bravado:
The “English Moralists” paper has been criticized as “amateur moral science,” but I find it difficult to take that criticism seriously. It has been demonstrated over and over again that the “history of ideas” is not something which people with a literary training cannot grasp. They do not need to be professional philosophers in order to attain such knowledge, or enough of it to enrich and illuminate their literary studies.
(“Moral science,” I should perhaps explain, is Cambridge’s term for philosophy.)
What Willey says here is not exactly untrue; but the extent to which it is true depends very much on what sort of history of ideas is in question, both the sort of ideas, and the sort of history. The kind of approach that comes from a concentration on philosophy will not perhaps be at a premium in studying ideas whose chief and most influential expression is not to be found in philosophers: the idea of progress, possibly, or the contemporary idea of honesty with oneself as a supreme moral ideal (the history of which is not yet written). Again, there may be a point for the history of ideas in not approaching even philosophers too philosophically; too nice a concentration on what they actually meant may disguise the influence that derived from their being misunderstood, and with some philosophers, Rousseau for instance, this is all-important. Yet while this is so, there will be some paradox in ignoring philosophy too much; for how is one to chart the misunderstandings, without philosophical understanding of what the philosopher really meant? At this point, there emerges the shallowness of Willey’s approach, with its academic classifications of “literary training” and “professional philosophers.” The truth, though simple, is more complex than the syllabus: that philosophical insight is not something separate from the literary understanding of philosophical writing, because it is not separate from understanding philosophical writing at all. Nor can there be a history of ideas without identification of ideas; and to identify what ideas are embodied in a text, particularly a philosopher’s text, is no less a matter of philosophical comprehension than of anything else (which does not mean that those with “a literary training” are debarred from reaching it).
Willey in fact adopts, of all possible courses, the one for which his professed lack of philosophical knowledge, and his evident lack of philosophical sense, least suits him: he gives up a good part of his book to trying just to state, as briefly as possible, the views of various philosophers. This is not a fruitful activity at best; under the present auspices, the outcome is a sustained exercise in missing the point. Two of the more important sufferers are Locke and Hume. Locke’s views on primary and secondary qualities, on substance, on revelation, and on the will, are variously mis-stated, misunderstood, or over-simplified; while some dark hints about “moral relativity” in his ethics are left untroubled by any statement of the fact that Locke actually aspired to make ethics into an a priori science. Locke is a confused thinker, indeed, but not boringly so, because his confusions are those of a highly intelligent and honest man trying to stand upright on intellectual ground that is shifting under his feet; Willey’s disservice is to make him dreary.
Hume inspires a rather more lively treatment, but it is no more accurate: important arguments (on the sense of duty and on miracles) are so stated as to omit precisely the basic idea, and Willey seems ignorant of important work on the interpretation of Hume, notably Kemp Smith’s on the Dialogues on Natural Religion. Hume is not in any case likely to get discriminating treatment, since, apart from the subtlety of his philosophy, he is an ironist, and irony seems in general to jam Willey’s apparatus: both Gulliver’s Travels and Candide are very crudely handled.
Willey’s insensibility to irony is equally apparent in his dealings with Aristotle, whose Magnanimous Man he takes for the ideal of the system. This interpretation has been accepted by some people; but it is surely mistaken and it scarcely gains much authority from Willey, who is prepared to say that the Ethics is one of “the world’s most boring classics.”
Aristotle is in fact the victim of something more interesting than misinterpretation: he is the prime casualty to Willey’s ideology, a sternly Protestant Christianity, which is expounded, relied on, and—consistently with its own spirit—very little analyzed. It sets the tone for the whole historical enterprise, the basic tradition of our civilization being found in a Platonic-Augustinian dualism, very disadvantageous to the flesh: man is a composite being, torn between impulses towards the higher and the carnal. No wonder that Aristotle, of less Manichaean disposition, gets such short shrift. Bad luck on the history of ideas that identifies either of these traditions as the guiding thread of Western thought. Even in the Middle Ages, the doctrine is in trouble, trouble which Willey gratuitously compounds for himself by claiming that “throughout the Middle Ages [Aristotle] was not merely an authority, but the authority.” This falsehood is mildly qualified on a later page; but Aristotle stays in the center, and it remains obscure whether Willey allows the Middle Ages to have been Aristotelian, because they were Christian, or is ready to admit that they were Aristotelian, because he himself is Protestant.
The ideologue can write history, even the history of what he rejects; the Enlightenment, for example, can be effectively studied by one who, as Willey does, regards the doctrine of Original Sin as a sure demonstration that all its ideals are hopeless. But such a study requires a complex feat of self-denial, a willing suspension of belief, a determination not to preach. In this Willey totally fails, with the result that parts of his book read like the grotesque sermon of a school chaplain warning the senior boys against the spiritual shortcomings of purely secular writings.
It is an ironical point that another of Willey’s Cambridge colleagues, Herbert Butterfield, shares Willey’s religious outlook, but bases on it an attitude to history which is totally, indeed extremely, the contrary: because of the pervasive sinfulness of man (as well as for other reasons) the historian must make no moral comment. A word from Butterfield would be valuable to any zealot who succeeds Willey in that famous course of lectures.

Universities: Protest, Reform and Revolution
It seemed right to try to say something about the discontents and student protests which have been, in Britain as elsewhere, troubling the universities; and certainly to undertake some discourse on the nature, purpose, role or whatever of universities, which did not take seriously the basic questions raised by what is going on, would be an idiotic evasion. However, I realise that in giving a lecture on these issues one runs a special risk of being tedious: on the one hand because events are running very fast, and problems which seem absolutely central at one point may even shortly afterwards seem less urgent or important; on the other hand, because many of the issues which obviously are central have already been so extensively discussed in public, and by many of us almost obsessionally in private, that one may well wonder whether anything remains to be said, and whether one may not be too groggy to recognise it if there is.
At least, in face of that difficulty, I shall be selective, and will leave out a lot of relevant things, resisting in particular (you may be relieved to hear) the temptations of a priori sociological explanation—why student protest has specially appeared so far at some institutions rather than at others, and at this time rather than earlier; to what extent, also, the causes to which it addresses itself are also the causes of its happening. On this last point, I shall assume only that many at least of the causes to which it addresses itself are worth taking seriously; this would seem to me to be so even if some of the motive power of protest comes from deeper or more general sources. I don’t think that any theory—historical, sociological, or even perhaps zoological—of why the banners are being raised is going to absolve one from honestly considering what is written on them.
Recent student protest has, obviously enough, been directed to two different sorts of issues, some of them concerned with how the university itself should be run, some of them with international or national political issues and a critique of the society in which the university exists. This last phrase itself shows, of course, that the two sorts of issue are by no means distinct, a point which radical protest insists upon. For one thing, internal disciplinary issues and questions of student freedom are very often precipitated by protests directed at the political issues; for another thing, protests against the university’s system are often seen as protests against features of society itself. I shall be saying some more about those more radical endeavours later on. For the moment, however, I should like to consider one or two of the issues that bear most directly on the university’s own structure and operation.
The joint statement of the NUS [National Union of Students] and the Vice-Chancellors, though it showed at various points, not surprisingly, thumb-prints from the heavy hand of compromise, seemed to me to offer many sensible suggestions; and I am going to start from the assumption that at least that much should be acceptable to university teachers and administrators. Anyone who is root and branch opposed to student participation in any university body except student societies and, perhaps, a joint catering committee, I shall not seek to persuade. The question seems to me about methods and limitations, and what principles should govern them, and the lines to be found between student participation, student freedom and student control. One such line that looks inviting, and is often invoked, is a line between the academic aspects of student life and its social aspects. It is often said, and very reasonably, that university authorities should be less fussed than many of them have been in the past with the regulation of students’ private lives, and that we should see an end to the battery of regulations still to be found in some places concerning where students go, when they come in, where they sleep and with whom. Moreover, where regulation is required, that a lot more of it should be totally delegated or left in the hands of students themselves, rather than handed down from on high. It looks as though many of us, though doubtless not all, may be able to agree on that general direction, without prejudice to what we may think about courses, examinations, syllabus and so forth.
I certainly think the general direction a sound one; and when the recommendations of the Latey Report on the age of majority are put into law, the legal decks will be cleared for treating students as adults. But in taking that view, one has got to be aware of certain consequences, and also of certain limitations which are going to be encountered, at least unless the system is changed in remoter respects. If one is not aware of these limitations, one courts the illusion endemic to mere liberalism, that change can be quite painless, and that the mere removal of old-fashioned restrictions will leave everything in just the same space that it was in before, only with a bit more room to move around in it. One courts also the nemesis of that illusion: the situation in which, discovering change after all to involve some pain, and that it all has a tendency to go further and in different directions than expected, panic sets in, the wheels of liberalisation are thrown into reverse, and one has the classic formula for a revolution. I offer here no argument for conservatism—only against sentimentality. Conservatism indeed has this one true premiss, that significant changes have unexpected consequences; but from that it invalidly derives its own illusion, that you can avoid unexpected happenings by seeking to avoid change. I am only saying that if introducing significant change, one had better expect the unexpected; and it helps to give some thought about what directions one should look in for its arrival.
In this matter of student freedom and self-determination in social matters, I shall mention just two directions in which I think we ought to be looking; there are certainly others besides. First, I think we have to give some thought to the question of how we reconcile this line with another aspiration that many have, towards a greater involvement of students and teachers together, and a less distant, less purely functional, relation of teachers to students than is found in some universities. For as things actually are, it looks as though the two things do not go together, but rather the contrary. The universities in which there is least fuss and control, by the very nature of things, over students’ private activities, are large, non-residential, urban institutions, in which students cram into lodgings, flats, studios, attics, in an unsupervised way, and lead—if they are lucky and not just doomed to loneliness—some autonomous kind of student life. Equally, and by the same token, they roll up for classes with teachers with whom they do not share (except in special cases) much of their private life, the teachers having likewise rolled up from leading, in the suburbs or wherever, some autonomous kind of teachers’ life. Opposed to this, we have a picture of the residential, organic university, with college life and free timeless converse between students and teachers; and those are just the places with the gating rules, one-sex colleges, and the Senior Tutor hiding behind the dustbins to catch them climbing over the wall.
Of course, both of these pictures are caricatures—and very much so the second. Nevertheless, they stand for a genuine conflict of aims which may not be irresoluble, but does need to be resolved. A very senior teacher from my university was reported in The Times recently as having criticised, in a speech to a society for the very intelligent, the younger generation of university teachers for being too concerned with their academic careers, and not enough with their pupils; married young, with small children, concentrated on research and publication, they left the undergraduates alone as much as possible. He was comparing the situation, I believe, with an older Oxbridge style, and of course in terms of that comparison there is much in what he says. But is that older style what a student would want now? Would the splendidly dedicated old don make much sense in the style of student freedom which is now sought, or in the institutions required to realise it? May not students, in a good number of respects, like being left alone to an extent which the older school would regard as involving a failure of tutorial responsibility?
I am afraid the answer to that last question is both yes and no, which is why there is a conflict of aims here. There is indeed one replacement for the old bachelor don, in terms of the more liberated and autonomous student life: namely, the young bachelor—or at least unfamilied—teacher, little older than the students, who spontaneously shares the style, social or political, that they favour. But his, in the nature of things, cannot be a general solution, for mere reasons of age; and we know from recent experience that the situation has its own difficulties, sometimes involving—to put a contentious issue in the antiseptic language of the social sciences—a certain confusion of roles.
I do not want to suggest that there is any large-scale or insoluble difficulty in these points. I do think, however, that one image of a university which goes very naturally with the aspirations to a less regulated student life clashes with an image which is on other grounds favoured; and such a conflict of images, if not made conscious and resolved as best it may be, is just the sort of thing that can leave people disorientated and in disarray.
The other matter that I think we ought to keep carefully in mind when moving towards student control of social arrangements refers particularly to discipline. Student participation in disciplinary committees and provisions of that type commands much assent; and it may be suggested further—indeed, it certainly has been suggested—that in some areas it is perfectly reasonable to put disciplinary control entirely into the hands of students. It may be that arrangements of this sort will prove, for certain purposes, entirely workable, and I myself certainly would not want to discount them in advance. But I felt that a colleague of mine had a point, who remarked that what chiefly worried him about such proposals was a fear that student bodies might prove too severe: a certain Jacobin dogmatism might make it go hard with students whose way of life or interests went in the currently disapproved direction. If there is anything to this, there may well be a case for retaining senior member participation in disciplinary procedures.
There is in any case the administrative point that the exaction of the penalties (unless they are of a very rough and ready sort) is likely to devolve on university authorities. But there is also the more general reason, that this may well be one of the areas in which the difference between senior members and junior members, that senior members go on for longer while junior members come and go, has some immediate relevance. This difference has been cited so often in connections where its relevance is not very obvious, that it has become a somewhat discredited observation, and its utterance virtually identified with a conservative reflex. But there are some connections in which it really is relevant, and this looks like one of them. For a student who finds himself in a certain climate of opinion, this just is the climate of the university: his experience of what it is like to be in a university is necessarily shaped by it. Senior members have an experience shaped by changes of climate, and while this can no doubt contribute to all those middle-aged deformations of cynicism, conservatism and so forth, it can also give rise to a fairly lively sense of the sorts of institutions and practices which can go on working fairly under shifting conditions, as the ideological wind blows with varying strengths in varying directions.
I turn now to one or two questions about student involvement in more academic matters, in particular matters of syllabus. Here again, there are some directions of reform which I for one, and I should suppose many here, would regard as highly reasonable. Thus it is entirely reasonable that students’ opinions and doubts about what is taught, should have some serious notice taken of them; and if it is felt that no notice gets taken of them if they are voiced individually and informally, then one will have, even if reluctantly, to invent some rather more formal machinery to convey them.
Two qualifications: of which the first is, that students must realise (and almost all students I have talked to do realise it) that they themselves have to see to it that the channels of communication are not overloaded with vast quantities of repetitious material. It really is not an essential test of an academic’s good faith, that he is prepared to be bored into the ground. If things get like that, anyone who is any good will go away, certainly from the meeting; and in the really long and terrible run, from that university.
The second qualification is that if students have the right to say to staff that they do not like the courses in these or those respects, and that they would like things to be done differently, the staff also has the right, if they happen to think that the students are talking ill-informed rubbish, to tell them so. It should hardly be necessary to say this; but there is a very odd view which one sometimes meets, some paternalist hang-over, according to which students should be allowed to say anything they like, but—since they are only students, after all—one should refrain from harsh criticism of what they say. This seems an utterly half-baked position. If academics are to be prepared to take student comment seriously, as they should be, they should extend to students the treatment they are happy to extend to their colleagues, of pointing out that something is idiotic, if idiotic is what it is.
I do not include among qualifications to projects of reform in this area, that students should discuss and not dictate, and that this is not a matter of student power. This seems to me, not a qualification to reform, but an absolutely necessary and limiting condition of it; and academics should regard this point as strictly non-negotiable, as they should regard the question of the appointment of university teachers. There are two reasons for this, both excessively and unsurprisingly well-known. One is the ‘boot-straps’ problem. It is straightforwardly a functional and relevant difference between junior and senior members that the latter know more about something, and are there to teach it to the former; and whatever advantages the junior members may or may not possess over the senior in moral enthusiasm or purity of heart, that difference is not cancelled out.
The second point is one that is usually put in terms of academic freedom: that academics should be free to teach their subjects as they see fit, free from pressures, particularly ideological pressures, from governments, churches, big business, populist movements—or mass meetings of students. This is indeed a fair way of putting it. But one may also put it in terms, not so much of freedom, as of integrity. Some very radical opinion seems sometimes to suggest that a teacher is morally at fault if he is unresponsive to demands that he should teach some particular kinds of material. Admittedly, he is at fault, and in very old-fashioned academic terms, if through narrow-mindedness he remains obstinately ignorant of important and serious developments. But, beyond that point, suppose he seriously thinks that the material is not so important as all that? Or what he is doing is more important? Or merely that, while the material may be interesting, he is not the man to do it justice, or that to do it justice would take him too much away from matters to which he thinks he has something to contribute? In short, what if he does not believe in it, or does not believe in it for him? Will it be a mark of virtue to give up what he does believe in, in order to put on some fashionable or well-regarded act of pursuing what he does not believe in? I should have thought that those who regard integrity as a cardinal virtue, and phoniness as a cardinal vice, would recognise to which category that performance would belong.
This last point is important, I think, even if we get away for a moment from the high ground of ultimate principle, and consider once more the area of desirable and possible reform. It is a very important limitation on proposals for syllabus reform in a given department, not only what the staff of that department can competently do, but what they can do genuinely. To take for a moment my own subject, which notably, though by no means uniquely, raises these problems: it would be an excellent idea for a philosophy department to provide, if it could, classes on certain thinkers not widely studied in this country, such as Nietzsche. But if, as things are, there is no one in the department who really cares about Nietzsche, to whom he means very much, it will be pointless to try to make them do it: a course on Nietzsche which is worth having cannot just be ‘laid on’. Nietzsche is to some extent a special case, but the same point applies more generally, and particularly to the sorts of subjects for which there is at present a lot of demand. Of course, this means that there is some reason, if further appointments are being made, to look out for someone who is good and can genuinely and at a serious level meet these wider demands; but, there again, one has (obviously enough) to watch that one is not preferring the fashionable to the creative, nor succumbing to the danger of producing, as in some American universities for instance, an anthology of points of view rather than a set of people who can actually do something together. ‘Non omnia possumus omnes’ is a maxim which applies to departments as well as to persons.
Perhaps a professor of philosophy is likely to be particularly conscious, among demands presently made on the syllabus, of what are, in the broadest sense, ideological demands. But it is important that there also exist demands, not least among students, that courses should be ‘relevant’ in a rather different sense: that they should be more relevant to what people are going to do after university—at the limit, that they should be more vocational. Some recent student demands give the impression that they embrace both these aspects of ‘relevance’ to the point of contradiction: on the one hand rejecting a university which allegedly churns out trained personnel on an assembly line in response to the needs of a mechanical society, on the other hand demanding that university courses do more to fit people into slots in society than they do at the moment.
There is indeed a kind of revolutionary outlook which would claim to overcome this contradiction, by seeking to change society in such a radical way that its slots (if it still had slots) would be filled precisely by people who had had a politicised, non-technical and unstructured experience in a radically changed university. I think in fact that this dream, besides its evident unrealism and the absurd picture it presents of the future of creative thought, contains a contradiction on the matter it cares most about—the avoidance of the mechanical. The contradiction, excessively briefly put, is this. Unless the theory belongs to the long series of agrarian fantasies—as Marxists used to say, utopian and reactionary fantasies—which have been a feature of much British socialist thought, it looks to a time when technology has not been abandoned, but rather has triumphed, and the labour of men has systematically been replaced by the operations of sophisticated machines. But either these machines are looked after and programmed by people, or they look after themselves. If they are run by a small number of people, not only will those people be technologically educated, but they will be the ultimate élite, the rulers of the world: contrary, surely, to the dream. But if the machines run themselves, then it will be machines which, in innumerable important respects, determine the living space of humans, and the machines, in effect, will rule the world: also, surely, contrary to the dream. One thing we can be fairly clear about, even with regard to these remoter prospects, is that if sophisticated machines are to replace a lot of labour we shall need a lot of people to be their masters, and a lot more people who will be at least their match; and that will require people who will be able to think technically about machines, and in a disciplined way about society. To abandon the more disciplined and rigorous intellectual activities on a large scale for more purely expressive and unstructured enterprises in education would be to prepare, not the liberated beneficiaries of that future society, but its certain victims.
If all this is to peer dimly into hypothetical futures, it is not wholly irrelevant to present discontents. In any case, no dream, even a better dream than that one, is going to get round the present conflict between demands for less vocationally functional, and for more vocationally functional, education. It is of course easier to point out the conflict, and to pinpoint some contradictions in student demands, than it is to respond adequately to the real frustrations that underlie them. But whatever thoughts we may arrive at about the relation of university courses to what students will later do (and a lot needs to be said here about the role of postgraduate courses, for instance), we certainly need to get the immediate diagnosis right about who, if anybody, is imposing what sort of pattern on whom. It is important to see that, in terms of what is actually happening now in this country, the universities are demonstrably not having imposed upon them demands of government or industry with regard to the needs for technically trained man-power. On the contrary, the agencies which bear most directly on universities, the DES [Department of Science] and the UGC [University Grants Committee], are busily engaged in that old liberal activity, of providing the means for people to realise their individual choices. Many committees, some headed by prominent academics, have shown that the country has an unsatisfied need for technologists and scientists, and tried to persuade universities to reflect this need; and in the late 50’s the UGC intended some two-thirds of new places in universities to be devoted to these subjects. As is also well-known, the proportion of potential students demanding those subjects first ceased to rise, and then fell; and, instead of trying to devise means by which screws could be put on universities or students to force people in the required direction, ‘society’—that is to say, in this case principally the UGC—heavily revised its allocations in the direction of providing more places in the humanities and social sciences. Much the same goes for the policies of the DES and local authorities towards Colleges of Further Education; when I visited a very prominent and expanding College of Technology a few weeks ago, I learned (with some surprise) that less than half of its students were doing technology or science. These developments seem to me important for an honest evaluation, both of revolutionary rhetoric about universities being the tools of a technological society, and also—as the Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge forcefully pointed out in his lecture in this series last year—of petulant and ill-informed complaints by some academics about inroads from these agencies into academic freedom.
There is a strong tendency in the most radical quarters, at least, to regard facts of this order as beside the point, and as at best expressions of a kind of a liberalism which happily puts up with, indeed (on the most radical view) actively fosters, the evils which political protest is directed against. This sort of critique borrows a lot from recent American experience, and radical American students are, not surprisingly, among the most prominent in certain universities here in pressing this sort of line. It would be absurd for me to embark here on a discussion of the failure of liberalism, if that is what it is, in American society, or of the extent to which basic problems of theirs are or are not paralleled here. Nor shall I try any serious evaluation of American academic troubles, such as the complex events at Columbia; that would itself be a very long job, even if I were capable of it. I think it is worth pointing out, however, certain differences in the university situation which for the most part obtains here, and that which has been the focus of criticism and protest in certain places in the United States; whatever one thinks of certain actions that have been taken there, what is certainly just false is the assumption that there is something called the ‘late capitalist university’ whose relations to society and to its students are the same in both countries.
There are several important points of difference. First, in the case of those prominent centres of university trouble in the United States, Berkeley and Columbia, there have been four sets of people involved: the trustees (or regents), the administration, the faculty, and the students, and the relations between all these four parties have caused difficulties—the regents (in the case of Berkeley) having political interests even against the administration, the administration taking decisions without concurrence of the faculty, and the faculty being—it is alleged—too remote from the students. This kind of set-up is not in general paralleled in this country, though one or two institutions may get rather nearer to it than the others. Correspondingly, if one takes the faculty and the students together, there is less ground for the feeling that their joint academic interests are being operated on from outside; and if one considers the relations between the faculty and the students, the claim that students are neglected or merely processed has less to feed on. Both points come out, if one remembers what—besides the money, the secretarial help, and the research apparatus—are the two great bribes extended to potential brain-drainers: that they will not have to teach, and that they will not have to administer. Of course American academics themselves do a great deal of teaching—more, for the most part, than the prestige British import who has been offered this inducement; but certainly they have handed over more in the way of administration than we have, and with it (some seem suddenly to have realised) control over what happens in their own institutions.
Another very important area of difference lies in the relations to money—both private money and defence money. There is nothing evil about private and industrial money in universities, and there is a lot of reason to be grateful for it, so long as the conventions that govern it keep it under control. But it is my impression that in certain American universities the trustees and administrators find themselves so deeply entangled in commercial and financial connections that freedom is lost. If one studies some of these situations, one may well feel that our arrangements for public money, so long at least as they are administered in the derided spirit of liberalism, can confer a greater degree of genuine independence than do these other arrangements, which are sometimes supposed to give greater freedom. The public money must, however, be in large part money devoted by society precisely to the purposes of education, and what it cannot be, in particular, is money devoted to defence. The lines between research devoted to military purposes, relevant to military purposes, and having nothing to do with military purposes, are famously difficult to draw; but the minimum principle, crude as it is, that universities should contain no classified research, seems to me of absolutely basic importance. This principle may seem to some to smell of the attitudes of Pontius Pilate, since (it may be said) the classified research goes on somewhere else, and one is merely squeamishly spared the embarrassment of having it on the premises. But, in any case, the principle that such research should not go on in universities is independent of whether one disapproves of classified research or not: even someone who approves of it will see the point that the distortions in the academic body set up by having it in universities are dangerous, and also that it is desirable that people should make it clear, by where they work, what their relations to it are. And if one does disapprove of it, or some of it, it is not hypocrisy to wish it to happen, if at all, somewhere else. One cannot eliminate everything one disapproves of from society, but one can do the best one can to see that those things are not done by bodies of which one is oneself a part, and for whose doings one is in some part directly responsible. The involvement of some American universities in defence contracts seems to me to have been a legitimate ground of protest.
I am not trying to say that American universities have been in all sorts of ways wicked, and we are marvellous. My point can be put merely by saying that even if there were equal grounds of protest in both places, they certainly could not be just the same, since factors which have figured very prominently in American protest are evidently different here. If those grounds are just transported across the Atlantic in a can, like a Hollywood film, and run here, it looks, to that extent, like another example of cultural imperialism.
So far I have spoken in large part about the grounds that protest may have in relation to a university, and about how those grounds may be, in certain areas I have singled out from many, met by reform. I should now like to look more closely at the activity of protesting in a university, and the relations of that activity to ideas of revolution—relations which are rather more complex and interesting than may appear on the surface. I think we can understand more or less what we mean by ‘a student protest’: they range from something slightly stronger and more irregular than merely sending a round robin to the Dean, and have many degrees of escalation up to sit-ins, strikes (a very ineffective weapon for students, incidentally), occupation of buildings and at the limit violence and destruction. They can be concerned, as I said at the beginning, with two different sorts of things: issues about the university itself, and wider political issues.
Now whatever one thinks of protests in general, one thing I think is clear is that one has to attach a special significance, from the point of view of a university, to continuous protests; and this applies to both types. So far as what we may call academic protests are concerned, it would be dishonest to deny that they do on occasion work, and produce some results that would not have been achieved, or so quickly, by the old channels of communication. The point about speed is of course particularly significant for students, who are not going to be there all that long, and may well have gone altogether by the time the unhurried processes of academic deliberation have dealt with the issue; even teachers can take this point, particularly when confronted with the kind of senior figure who always says, at the prospect of some reform, “it will come”, as though that relieved everyone of bringing it about that it come. But, if, by the very fact of being students with a short career, students have an interest in the speed that protest can occasionally secure, it is also true, and by the very same fact, that they have an interest in protest not being continuous. Protest being by definition to some extent disruptive, the price they pay for continuous disruption during their university career must be, by the same argument, proportionately high. If some protest shifts a blocked system, and in particular encourages reforms which themselves may make protest less necessary to get later reforms, continuous protests designed to get reforms must be progressively self-defeating. So, granted at least that some results have been achieved, continuous protests will, if they have any rationale at all, probably have to have a rationale which is not primarily concerned with securing reforms, but with something else.
A similar point can be made with regard to political protest, but in slightly different terms. It might be said that in this case continuous protest had a much better justification, since, first, it is much less likely to have produced any results, and, second, the subject will be of greater national or world importance, indeed of greater moral importance, than arrangements in a university. These two points are true, but they do not make the case. The war in Vietnam, world hunger, the bomb, are issues vastly more important than anything I or any student will do; but it doesn’t follow from that that protesting about these issues is more important than anything else I or he can do. If one is overwhelmed by the appalling feeling that what one is fiddling around with is completely dwarfed by such issues, one might think, as a few do, in terms of a more adequate individual response, such as working in famine relief or serving in some capacity in Vietnam. Few make such a response, and there are very few of whom one would think it was positively demanded; for most of us, making a protest may have to serve as a symbolic substitute, and it would seem to me quite frivolous and facile to say ‘no protest—either complete dedication, or shut up’. But what is equally frivolous and facile is to suppose, granted that one is sticking to symbolic protest, that the more one protests the nearer one approximates to the unrealised dedication. Either one feels that there are values and aims which can honourably be pursued despite the world’s sufferings, or one does not. If one does not, there is only dedication. If one does, then one has to realise that that is what one is doing, and not muck up those aims and values for oneself and others by confusing persistence in the symbolic with dedication to the actual.
If I am right so far, it just does not follow that if protest is occasionally a good thing, more protest must be a better thing; with both academic and political protest, continuous protest is by the very nature of the cases, a relevantly different thing, and not just more of the same. So for continuous protest, a rationale is demanded which goes beyond the justifications for occasional protest. What may it be? One, on the academic side, is if things are outrageously bad and no-one will move at all; another, on the political side, is if there is a real chance of actually securing a large change about the matters to which the protest is directed. I shall leave these, since I do not think that either of them is the case with virtually any situation which presently concerns us. There is another: that, on the academic side, of aiming at a change which is itself radical to a degree which no amount of mere reform could meet, and which the present authorities could not possibly grant. When I say that this would be a possible rationale of continuous protest, I do not mean that I agree with it: all I mean is that it is an objective in terms of which continuous protest might make sense, as it does not without some special objective. It looks, from reports, as though some student groups have such an objective with regard to the LSE [London School of Economics].
I myself think that the sort of institution which some members of the RSSF [Revolutionary Socialist Students’ Federation] seem to want would, if imaginable at all, be a nightmare, which would make impossible the things that have to be sustained in a university (such as finding out the truth), and would also rule out the sort of critical understanding of society which can support genuine programmes of social action. Although the principles involved in these points are of course of the first importance, I shall not go on about them; I want just to make the point that in any case the objective of trying by continuous protest to turn an institution such as the LSE into that sort of place is an absurd as well as a destructive objective.
It is absurd, because there is no conceivable mechanism by which such groups could inherit an institution such as the LSE. One cannot quite see the UGC, for instance, complacently supporting an LSE which, if that final day came, would have been deserted by its administration, most of its teachers, and large numbers of its students. This is obviously true anyway; and it must be at least as obviously true on the extremists’ own views of our society. If the aim is to have a certain sort of school—let us, just for the sake of a label and no more, call it a ‘revolutionary school’—the aim of making the LSE, a place with certain buildings, a library, resources, government support, and a body of teachers, into that school is a very unrealistic way of going about it. But I doubt in fact whether the aim is just to have a revolutionary school. This is based purely on a suspicion, but I think a well-founded suspicion, which is this. Suppose someone came up and actually offered to provide premises and resources for a revolutionary school (a proposal seriously advanced by a weekly paper some time ago): how many students or staff in the LSE or elsewhere who are in favour of such a school would go off to it? I suspect that many would not. If that suspicion is right, it seems to follow that the aim is not in fact just to get a revolutionary school. To work on an existing institution is not just regarded as the only available way of bringing about a revolutionary school: to work on an existing institution is probably essential to the project—presumably as being either symbolic or anticipatory of a wider revolutionary project.
‘Symbolic’ or ‘anticipatory’ is here a vital distinction, and just as vital to potential revolutionaries as to anyone else. With revolutions, as serious revolutionaries know, it makes a great deal of difference whether a revolution is actually likely to happen, and if so who is likely to win. There seems to me only one thing more certain than that a revolution is not going to happen in this country: and that is, that if it did, the Right would win. There are indeed suppressed political feelings in this country which are not adequately expressed in our politics; but they are very largely feelings which support more and not less authoritarian, chauvinistic and xenophobic measures. Nor can the fantasists of the revolutionary Left, with the slightest vestige of plausibility, embark on those age-old strategies of aiming first at Rightist power, and eventually, by politicization of the oppressed masses, to the revolution they want: that is not how it would be, either.
Disruption of universities as anticipatory of real revolution is a project patently insane. The activity has to be seen rather as symbolic; but how, and to what effect? I think I must leave the answer to ‘how’ to those who support these views; the questions of what this symbol is supposed to symbolise, and what its value is, seem to me questions well pressed on those who advocate these courses, by those who immediately have to suffer from them. But one can certainly give some answers to the question ‘with what effect?’: the effect, noted by very many students, that every less liberal attitude in the country gets aroused against students’ interests in general.
To choose a university, in any case, as the object of either symbolic or real revolution is basically pretty mad, as some speakers pointed out to students at Columbia; a lot of what it stands for is nearer to the ideals of the revolutionaries themselves than are other institutions. And to reply that the university is where one is, and is notably easier to deal with than those other institutions, is straightforwardly childish; it is on all fours with admitting that the reason one is nasty to one’s father is that, while he is actually a bit nicer than the people one really hates, he is the one who is at home and gets upset.
While real revolution is not on, and symbolic revolution has little obvious point and many counter-productive results, the confusion of the real and the symbolic from which some evidently suffer is disastrous from every point of view. It can breed, in particular, a special kind of moral confusion. It is a platitude that, confronted with a real revolutionary situation, certain constraints go to the wall: intimidating the unenthusiastic, breaking up the meetings of those on the other side, and so forth, begin to look not only permissible but imperative. But whatever one may do if the revolutionary situation is really there, to get to this point in the interests of a fantasy is totally destructive, and self-destructive. I believe that very few have got to this point, but the emotional power of the fantasy situation makes it possible. I said that to reach this point was self-destructive, and I mean that in two senses. First, by generating an atmosphere in which belonging to the cause alone counts, and disagreeable voices are made inaudible, the individual loses his own sense of self-criticism, ceases to listen to what he himself says, and loses his grasp on reality. Second, he destroys his own cause, and any like it; for (as I have already said) in anything like our situation, it is in the end the other side that can shout louder and kick harder. Letting people be heard is a good policy anyway, but it is a particularly good policy for minorities.
One last point. Rousseau said that he regarded as the best state, that in which the citizens spent as much time as possible in thinking about public matters, and as little as possible in thinking about private matters. It has always seemed to me a good test of certain basic political attitudes, whether one spontaneously finds that a sympathetic remark, or, as I do, a repulsive one. Either reaction, but particularly that second one, is going in fact to need qualification; one qualification (by no means the only or most important) is that one may have to turn aside from legitimate private activities for a bit if those very activities, and those of other persons, look like being jeopardised. Now I don’t in fact think that the activities of the most militant in universities have a very significant effect, as they would claim, in making people more concerned about genuine public issues of war and peace, hunger and oppression; what they do is to make the people around terribly concerned about universities, which is something else. Though that is a fairly private concern relative to those other problems, it is a public concern relative to one’s own work and teaching; and faced with real militancy, those who do not believe in it do have, for a time, to get actively moving in the public terrain. Those who just want to be able to do what they want to do, will certainly, in order to secure that, have to do a good deal of what they don’t want to do.
Has ‘God’ a Meaning?
People are often tempted to think of questions about meaning as though they were all on the level of the most trivial disagreements about the use of a particular word, the sort of disagreements that are rightly called ‘merely verbal’: exemplified, for instance, in the fact that Americans use the word ‘suspenders’ to refer to what we call ‘braces’. Obviously, no sane person would waste time arguing about which was the right word to use, or what the word ‘suspenders’ really meant. But most questions about meaning are not nearly as superficial as this, and in issues of metaphysics or religion we cannot proceed in this way.
Philosophers have become extremely conscious of the fact that it is possible to use language in an impressive and profound-seeming way, without what one says having any meaning at all, or at least—and this is an important point—without its having the sort of meaning that the speaker would like it to have.
Some speaker may think that he is making an important statement about the nature of the universe, or of history, or something, and it may turn out, when he is pressed, that no meaning has been given to his sayings which is determinate enough for him to be making any recognizable claim at all. In particular, this will be so if there is nothing definite to distinguish what is involved in this man’s claim from what would be involved in denying that claim. There has to be a difference between what things are like if it is true and what things are like if it isn’t. If there is really no difference between what things are like if a certain claim is true, and what they are like if it is not true, we can say that that claim has no content at all.
One very simple example, from the field of religious belief: and I should say at once that I don’t think that to criticize the sort of view I am going to mention is, in itself, to criticize any serious form of religious belief, since few serious religious believers would believe anything as simple as this. But there have been people who have thought that God’s purposes were positively manifested in natural disasters such as eruptions and earthquakes; for instance, by the punishment of wicked persons overwhelmed by these catastrophes. It is pointed out that the same catastrophes tend rather indiscriminately to involve also innocent persons, such as small children; or presumably virtuous persons, such as members of religious orders. The simple believer then replies that this manifests God’s purpose in another way, since it is good that the innocent and virtuous should go to Heaven.
He is then asked, presumably, why other innocent and virtuous persons are not given this benefit to go to Heaven quickly, but left to suffer on earth to a hearty old age; and many of the wicked, indeed, seem to do quite well and are not despatched. Something is then said to the effect that it is also good that the virtuous should have life on earth, and that the punishment of the wicked be delayed for a while, and so on. And after all this we see that absolutely anything that happened to the virtuous, the wicked, or the in-between will count equally well; natural calamities directed by God turn out to be utterly indistinguishable in principle from natural calamities not directed by anyone; and the content of the claim that the happening of such incidents reveals any sort of Divine purpose dissolves in thin air.
As I said before, I don’t think the very naïve view I’ve just mentioned would be held by serious religious believers; in fact, I believe it would be condemned by them, as superstitious. The fact that this superstitious view turned out to be vacuous and have no content would be held by many sceptical philosophers to be the case, in a more sophisticated way, as regards the central tenets of a religion such as Christianity. One form of this more general sort of philosophical criticism was advanced by the ‘logical positivists’.
Logical positivism started in the early years of this century, and was developed principally in Vienna in the ’twenties. It became known in this country through a very remarkable book by Professor A. J. Ayer, called Language, Truth, and Logic, which was published in 1936. The positivists held that there were only two sorts of statements that genuinely have meaning. One sort were statements which were true merely because of the definitions of the terms used in them: a boring example is ‘all bachelors are unmarried’. These need not bother us. The other sort of meaningful statement consisted of those that could be shown to be true or shown to be false by some possible sense-experience: for instance, by some possible scientific experiment or observation. All other remarks not of these two types were considered by the positivists to be meaningless. This doctrine obviously dealt pretty hard with statements of religion, which certainly don’t seem to be typically verifiable by science.
Many philosophers now would agree that a principal criticism of logical positivism was the very narrow view it took of something’s being meaningful. It is obviously wrong just to lump together as meaningless everything that fails the positivist test; pieces of poetry, commands, expressions of wishes, and lots of other pieces of ordinary meaningful language fail the test and yet have meaning. The positivist challenge has helped to make philosophers more conscious of different sorts of meaning. While this is so, I do not think that the positivist position, in an essential respect, is just to be dismissed. For even if it overlooked a lot of kinds of meaning, it seems to me at least roughly right about one central sort of meaning: the sort of meaning which belongs to statements which one can claim to be true or false. This point can be made in terms of belief: that to believe is to believe something, and if there is anything that one believes, one ought to be able to say in some way—if not in the very narrow terms of sense-experience—what the difference is between what one believes being true and what one believes not being true. In the case of religious statements, in particular statements about God, the important question, to my mind, is not whether they have a meaning, or no meaning: the important question is, what sort of meaning they have.
And this is a question which affects whether one wants to go on making such statements or not.
There is no doubt that some people at some times have given a meaning to the statement that God exists, and to other statements about God, which came very near to making those statements into a sort of supplement to science: God came in where science left off. This is the God which the Bishop of Woolwich called in his book Honest to God ‘the God of the gaps’—the gaps, that is to say, in science. Taken in this way, statements about God were certainly not empty or vacuous in the sort of way I have been talking about before. They made a fairly definite claim: that certain phenomena, such as the adaptation of animals to their environment, or, again, the existence of living things, did not admit of a scientific explanation. These negative claims that certain sorts of scientific explanation were impossible were certainly not empty; the trouble was that they have turned out to be false, since such scientific explanations are forthcoming and there is every sign that they will go on being forthcoming. So if that was the sort of thing meant by religious statements, if that was the sort of meaning they had, they would have to be written off as a hopeful bet against science, which science won.
At this point, some modern theologian may come along, and say something like this: ‘I agree that the attempts to make God fill in holes in science is hopeless: the existence of God is not a hypothesis, supplementary to science, and never should have been regarded as such.’ I also think the theologian may justly add that these sorts of arguments do a disservice to religion by making God into an abstract or scientific object, instead of something of living concern to people. ‘Christianity is about people caring; it essentially involves taking a serious attitude to the world, to personal relationships, to society. When someone says he is a Christian, and that he believes in God, it is such an attitude that he declares. His statements of his religion are not meaningless: they have just this meaning, that the speaker declares such an attitude to life.’
This modern theologian I have made up is at best a composite figure; he is probably a caricature. But the tone is familiar. And my reply to him is this. ‘If that is what Christian remarks mean, and only that, then people should stop making them. The Christian vocabulary is unnecessary; if you want to say “I care about personal relationships”, we have a very good English sentence for saying that, which does not mention God—namely the sentence, “I care about personal relationships”. What is worse, the Christian vocabulary is, for the purpose you give it, actively misleading. For it is quite obvious that historically the claims of Christianity have not just been ways of expressing certain attitudes to the world and to other people: they have been taken to be, if true, very important truths which give reasons for having those attitudes towards personal relationships and so on. To represent the words of Christianity as merely expressing these essentially secular attitudes is in fact to have given the thing up, while retaining the vocabulary.’
It may be objected that I am engaged in the old sceptics’ game of insisting that Christianity be represented in the most conservative and implausible forms so that I go on disbelieving it. I hope that that is not what I am doing. What I am rather trying to do is to insist that if Christianity is to be Christianity at all there has to be something to be believed or disbelieved, and that this has to be something over and above a mere belief about the secular order.
Christianity is a religion which is very historically articulate; one knows a good deal about what has been believed at different stages of its development. It is also a religion which is tied to certain texts, in particular, of course, the Bible and of course to a particular figure, Christ, about whom one is told something in those texts. Given this, it seems to me possible to identify certain beliefs which must be held if it is Christianity that is being believed at all. I will suggest just one—very unambitiously and, one would hope, platitudinously. This is that God is transcendent to human affairs and to human attitudes in a sense which has the following consequence (though it is supposed to mean more as well): that God would exist whether human beings and their attitudes existed or not—even if there were no human beings or human aspirations, there would still be a God.
To believe this is certainly not enough to constitute one’s being a Christian, as I understand it. A Christian has, for instance, to go on to say something very special about Christ (and not just that Christ was a better moral teacher than Socrates). But I shall leave the rest, and concentrate on this one point: that to believe what I just very roughly spelled out is at least necessary to having Christian beliefs. And I think it is worth asking oneself very carefully when confronted with some reinterpretation of Christian doctrine whether it passes this test: that it represents God as a being who would be there even if no human beings, or indeed other finite conscious beings, were there. If it does not, then I suspect you no longer have any form of Christianity, but probably some form of religious Humanism.
All this is still about meaning. I said the problem was about what Christian and other religious statements are said to mean. There is a limit to what they can be made to mean; when their meaning has changed too much, in particular when it is identified too closely with a meaning which refers only to human life, there is no point in going on making them in the religious form. Sometimes of course—perhaps one must say, very often—it is not at all easy to discover whether this has happened or not: clouds of ambiguity stand in the way. In this connection I think we should look extremely closely at a famous passage from Paul Tillich’s The Shaking of the Foundations (pp 63 f) quoted in Honest to God, which seems to suggest that to deny that God exists is to deny that life has depth. Tillich wrote: ‘The Name of this infinite and inexhaustible depth and ground of all being is God. That depth is what the word God means. And if that word has not much meaning for you, translate it, and speak of the depths of your life, of the source of your being, of your ultimate concern, of what you take seriously without any reservation. Perhaps, in order to do so, you must forget everything traditional that you have learned about God, perhaps even the word itself. For if you know that God means depth, you know much about him. You cannot then call yourself an atheist or unbeliever, for you cannot think or say: Life has not depth. Life is shallow. Being itself is surface only. If you could say this in complete seriousness, you would be an atheist; but otherwise you are not. He who knows about depth knows about God.’ This raises many questions. In the sense in which ‘life has depth’ is a statement which only superficial people are going to reject—can it really be enough to represent what ‘God exists’ is supposed to mean? When people said that God exists were they really saying just that life has depth?
Is Tillich really saying that believing in God is just the same as not being superficial? If not, what more? What sort of thing does his pervasive phrase, ‘the ground of our being’, mean? Is the ‘ground of our being’ something that would be there even if we were not? Or is the ‘ground of our being’ something more like our deepest aspirations, which presumably would not be there if we were not?
I do not think that ‘God’, or statements containing that word, have no meaning. I think they can have all sorts of meanings. On some, they are very difficult to interpret indeed. On others, they seem to me to make claims which can be at least well enough identified to be seen to be substantial; in those meanings, which are various, the claims seem to me personally, I must say, to be false. But at least there is something to be false, and something to be disbelieved. In yet other meanings that are given to them, they say nothing, or too little, or something of the wrong sort—representing, for instance, merely some human aspiration. Then there is nothing to be false, nothing to disbelieve. But when that is so, there is nothing to be true, nothing to believe, either.
Russell and Moore: The Analytical Heritage, by A. J. Ayer
In the annals of twentieth-century philosophy, the early alliance of Bertrand Russell and G. E. Moore is famous, as the principal contribution to the undermining of the temporary and untypical influence of Idealism on British thought. Moore, at that time, influenced Russell; at various times Russell’s work provided Moore, who was always disposed to start from other philosophers’ sayings, with material to criticise. They each greatly influenced analytical philosophy. But they were very different philosophers, with extremely different temperaments and types of achievement. Ayer indeed treats them separately in this book (which is derived from his William James lectures at Harvard), dealing first with Russell and then with Moore.1
Bloomsbury, famously, favoured Moore, mainly (it seems) because of the intensity and purity of his personality, and on the strength of ‘Principia Ethica,’ which found intrinsic good notably in aesthetic experience and personal relations; Russell it seems to have regarded with the same suspicion as Keynes—he gave signs of being busy, worldly and liable to contribute to some positive science. Ayer’s book, however, does not deal with any of that: it sticks sternly to the philosophers’ arguments on logical questions and topics in the theory of knowledge, intellectual and cultural history left firmly on one side.
It does, however, deal with the more recent and professional reasons for favouring Moore, which have had some currency among British philosophers. This attitude has insisted that Russell, for all his great achievements in logic and the foundations of mathematics, is both a more traditional and a more slapdash philosopher than Moore: more traditional, because he took the brisk advancing of theories, sometimes surprising, to be philosophy’s business, while Moore saw that there was a problem about both the nature and the extent of the philosopher’s power to refute common-sense; more slapdash because he lacked Moore’s intense kind of unflashy seriousness in trying to say exactly what he meant. Russell, it has been said, looks back to Hume; Moore looks forward or sideways to Wittgenstein and J. L. Austin.
Ayer, who is sympathetic to both his subjects, but more (it is fairly evident) to Russell, has some interesting things to say in criticism of this by now familiar view. In particular, he shows how little is defended by Moore’s celebrated ‘defence of common-sense’—a good deal less than is often ascribed to it by some subsequent enthusiasts for ‘ordinary language.’ Moore thought that while there were various beliefs of common-sense, disputed by philosophers, which were certainly true, the question of the analysis of those beliefs—what they really involved and meant—was almost entirely open; and as Ayer reminds us, he was prepared to entertain some peculiar and indeed theory-laden suppositions about what their analysis might involve.
I think that there are also some questions to be raised about Moore’s famous care and precision, to which virtues he raised an ugly monument in his grinding style, which reads often like some legal document. This style assists sometimes the appearance rather than the reality of precision, and is capable of conveying a kind of emphatic vagueness which curiously co-exists with the marks of solicitor-like caution. Moore’s definition of ‘x in this usage is an incomplete symbol,’ which Ayer quotes, provides a rich example:
In the case of every sentence, p, in which x occurs with this meaning, there can be formed another sentence, q, for which p is short, such that neither x itself nor any expression for which x is short occurs in q, and p always looks as if the rest of it expressed a propositional function, such that the proposition expressed by p is a value of that function, whereas in fact it never does.
Such a sentence in fact just does not have the virtues which could alone compensate for its vices.
Ayer does not range very widely beyond the exposition and criticism of particular arguments and positions of the two philosophers, and there are points at which the book tends to sink a bit discouragingly between two stools, where the treatment is too analytical to give much historical insight, but the philosophical rewards are too slight to make the discussion of the Russellian or Moorean topic worthwhile in its own right. But this is only at points; he has organised and set out with great lucidity and skill a great deal of material, and puts us in control of the philosophers’ arguments. If not all the arguments are equally fascinating, it is not Ayer’s fault for reminding us that both these men worked their way in their time over some peculiarly unfruitful territory.

Immanuel Kant, by Lucien Goldmann
Lucien Goldmann is best known in Britain for his study of Pascal and Racine (Le Dieu Caché, 1955; translated as The Hidden God, 1964). He died in 1970; he has been commemorated in Cambridge by the Memorial Lecture which Raymond Williams gave last year. This book1 is a translation of Goldmann’s first book, his doctoral thesis at Zürich, which was published there under the title Mensch, Gemeinschaft und Welt in der Philosophie Immanuel Kants. A French translation was first published in 1948, followed by a second French edition in 1967, with the rather less informative title Introduction à la philosophie de Kant.
When Goldmann wrote this book he was very much under the influence of Lukács, an influence which indeed continued, but which he came to put into a longer perspective; thus even in the introduction to the 1948 translation he modifies the extravagance which in the first version placed Lukács alone of twentieth-century philosophers alongside Hegel and Marx. The book constitutes a ‘humanistic’-Marxist interpretation of Kant, and in both respects it is unusual. It is unusual among interpretations available to English readers in being Marxist and it is unusual among Marxist interpretations in being genuinely devoted to Kant, both in the sense of being actually, if eccentrically, about him, and also in the sense of saluting him and his thought as a recognition at the deepest level of humane values which (in Goldmann’s view) were later to be more fully and adequately expressed by Marx. Goldmann denies the aim of writing a work of Kantian scholarship, seeking rather to produce a work of philosophy, yet in fact there is a good deal of reference to and exposition of the Kantian texts, and the book even has the overall structure of an expository outline, starting with an historical background chapter (of a sort), and proceeding via the theory of knowledge and ethics to political and religious doctrines.
The key concept for Goldmann in Kant’s thought is totality, a concept associated intimately with that of community. Goldmann’s thesis is that Kant, both in his theory of knowledge and in his ethics, shows himself sensitive to the limitations and ultimate emptiness of ‘bourgeois’ and individualist conceptions, and strives towards a conception of a human community which will indeed be based on reason, but which will transcend the limitations of these atomistic conceptions. However, owing to the limitations of his time and place—the particular limitations of late 18th century Prussian intellectual life play an important role, both negatively and positively, in Goldmann’s account—he could not conceive of such a community, as later it was to be conceived by Marx and (very imperfectly indeed) by Hegel, as lying in the future; he conceives it rather as lying in the region of the ideal, and the role which should be played by the philosophy of history is still, in Kant’s thought, played by the philosophy of religion. As Goldmann puts it: ‘In the critical philosophy, where man’s limitation and the problem of his destiny predominate, only secondary importance is ultimately accorded to the philosophy of history; there is only a present, duty, and an eternity, religion, but no future, no history; this is the clearest expression of that ultimate limit beyond which, despite all his efforts, Kant was never able to pass.’
To some extent, Goldmann brings his account into relation to humane values as they can be perceived outside Marxism, and this not only makes him more sympathetic, in all senses, than many Marxist writers, but sustains some awareness of seemingly paradoxical elements in Marxism itself. Thus a constant theme, particularly among some American historians of ideas, has been the amount that many progressive or revolutionary philosophies have had in common with chiliastic and religious outlooks of the past: an observation deployed usually in a reductive spirit, and often justly so. But someone wishing to use that implement against Goldmann will need a firmer hold on it, since he clearly recognizes that to regard Kant’s religious and moral aspirations as prefiguring Marxist revolutionary hopes is equally to see those hopes as expressing something in common with religious aspirations: the critic’s observation is accepted, and the critic is seen as, too often, merely having begged the question about which way round it is to be used.
Goldmann is, in this work, exceedingly unabashed about the extent of historical aspirations. He quotes Heine: ‘Wir wollen hier auf Erden schon das Himmelreich errichten’ and adds that he ‘thus expressed the essential content of modern humanism’. The statement is surprising enough. It remains surprising, even when two points have been allowed for: first, that the statement is in some part definitional of what Goldmann means by ‘humanism’, and second, that the ‘essential content’ relates to a hope, not to a prediction, so that part of humanism may be, as Goldmann claims it is in Kant, and was later to find it in Pascal and Racine, a tragic vision, which combines a belief in the pointfulness of human effort—and hence (Goldmann claims) at least not a certainty that it will be unsuccessful—with a deep lack of certainty that it will or could be successful. Goldmann is exciting and suggestive on a tragic element in Kant’s philosophy, and I shall come back to that.
His own explanation of it, however, is intricately involved in his Marxist structure; for he has to explain why the aspirations after a human community take this tragic form in Kant, and this turns out to be connected with the social situation of the German bourgeoisie in that period. He has to go further, since even if that type of explanation could make a dent on the questions concerning the moral philosophy, it would seem conspicuously to underdetermine Kant’s theory of knowledge. He does go further; and while one gets the impression that the application of specifically Marxist categories to the Critique of Pure Reason is a bit episodic, it is not exactly half-hearted, and although Goldmann’s outlook (so far as I can see) is flexible enough to leave room for a good deal of internalist or non-ideological explanation of a philosophical work, he has not here systematically made use of it. The result is an irritating mixture of extreme vagueness on general points, and a reckless disregard of historical truth on a lot of particular ones; and it is a pity, since a reader may be put off by all that before he gets to some excellent insights.
Some of the more knock-about treatment of the history of philosophy is not so much connected with any specifically Marxist approach, but is rather a general feature of certain European philosophical styles, of the kind amusingly if cantankerously castigated by J.-F. Revel in his Pourquoi des Philosophes? and elsewhere. Like the 18th century Paris orchestra, so the 20th century Paris philosopher must start with a coup d’archet, and a fortissimo burst of surprising assertion takes one’s breath away in the first chapter. ‘All the great German philosophical systems start out from the problem of morals, from the “practical”, a problem virtually unknown to French philosophers before Bergson’ (p. 41). What about Rousseau, on the one side, or Leibniz on the other? Well, Rousseau is never mentioned at all, which is quite remarkable in a work covering this ground; as for Leibniz, it is claimed that ‘the problem of morals already occupies a preponderant place’ (p. 42), which is a bit weaker than the claim made on the page before, but is still quite untrue. Yet more remarkable is the explanation of why Germany, as opposed to France, has so few comic and satirical writers: ‘… one can only laugh at that which is already virtually overcome and brought down; one laughs when the future is open, when one has the whole people behind one. That is why laughing has become almost a national virtue in France’ (p. 45).
One might, I suppose, charitably take it that this kind of remark in this genre of work does not actually aim at truth at all, and that it is an error of literary judgement to suppose that it does. What is said in cafés in Paris is not, in point of seriousness, so unlike what is said in saloon bars in London—it is merely that in Paris there is a greater disposition to print it. But this principle of interpretation cannot be extended too widely, and a point soon comes where the distinctive Marxist thesis of the book has to be called in question.
In general, the Marxist treatment of Kant’s theory of knowledge which Goldmann offers depends on a kind of analogical thinking which is exceedingly mysterious in its backing, and hence, often, in its content. He claims that Kant in his analysis of the limitations on human knowledge ‘lays the philosophical foundations for a most penetrating critique of bourgeois individualist society’ and that ‘this critique of the thought and action of individualist man is to be found in the Aesthetic of the Critique of Pure Reason and the two Analytics of the Critique of Pure Reason and the Critique of Practical Reason’ (p. 110).
These claims seem to be based on, and to offer, no more than a loose structural or symbolic analogy between certain features which supposedly obtained in Prussian society, and certain features of the Kantian philosophy, as for instance its insistence on the notion of the ‘synthesis of a totality’ being ‘set as a task’. That Kant himself saw his enterprise in quite a different light, and precisely and emphatically claimed that his results obtained for humanity as such, is of course admitted, but dismissed as a familiar kind of limitation. A few remarks about the sociology of knowledge do nothing to make these procedures less arbitrary.
This is of course excessively familiar ground. But in reading Goldmann, I am struck forcibly by something which can strike one also in the pages of phenomenologists, or, again, of Lévi-Strauss: the degree to which this is essentially magical thought, the primitive conception that similarities must point to powers, and analogies in thought stand for a kind of causation. As magical, it is also at a deep level comforting: and in more than the way in which Goldmann, very frankly and explicitly, makes it a demand on a philosophy that it should hold out hope for the future. (The element of comfort makes this kind of philosophical thought a weak candidate, in the long run, for radical critics of analytical philosophy to run as an alternative, since in that contrast the bleak elements of analytical philosophy must appear as witness to its being more honest and more grown-up: while in other connexions, that is not all that is to be said about its bleakness.)
Goldmann in fact, at a more particular level, has some difficulty in stopping the supposed Marxist explanations from collapsing into something too indistinct to be of any use to him. Thus one application he makes of Lukács’ concept of reification (a very close relative of alienation) is to thought which radically separates a priori judgements from the empirically given; and this reification is closely associated with ‘the modern bourgeois individualist order’ (p. 127), an association filled out by references to the stock-market, the prices of commodities, etc. This seems to face the difficulty that perhaps the most notable example of this type of thought in the history of philosophy was Plato, who was not modern, nor bourgeois, nor confronted with a stock-market. Later on (p. 150–1) the possibility of reification seems indeed to be admitted to the rise of theoretical philosophy in ancient Greece—a rise itself associated, by a familiar Marxist tack, with Ionian trade patterns. So now ‘modern’ and ‘bourgeois’ seem to have given way to a more generous category, of persons engaged in trade; and in terms merely of Marxist theory itself, the question arises whether the association of these patterns of thought with the bourgeois stage of development was not a mistake, and the association should be, much more basically, with the division of labour. But if that, then much of the distinctive thesis of this book evaporates. Moreover, since these associations are anyway made in the most abstract terms, one might ask whether the ‘conditions of production’ with which these patterns of thought are to be associated may not turn out to be the conditions of any production whatsoever, in which case one will be rapidly returning to the original Kantian claim, that his theories were valid for humanity as such. Many different views, in principle, might be possible along this route: Goldmann does not in fact provide us with the materials to make anything determinate out of any of them.
Much of the theoretical material of this book is at best empty. But in among the theoretical materials there are certainly living and interesting things. One question in particular about Kant gains illumination from what Goldmann says, even though he does not directly approach it: why is it that Kant, who emphasizes over and over again that his theory of knowledge applies only to creatures who, like men, learn about the world through sense-perception, offers on the other hand a moral philosophy which purports to apply to any rational creature as such? Why not the same restriction for both theory and practice? The answer to this question leads into the heart of Kant’s views about freedom and rational agents as ends; Goldmann offers interesting thoughts in this area. Again, he brings out in particularly striking ways the difference between Kantian and utilitarian thought, and equally the divergence between Kantian enlightenment and general 18th century views about progress. Above all, he convincingly brings out, as I mentioned before, a tragic aspect to Kant’s thought, embodied particularly in the aspiration to a rational ethical world. Kant said: act as if the maxim of your action were to become through your will a universal law of nature. Goldmann writes: ‘ “As if through your will”—in those five words Kant expresses in the clearest and most precise manner the grandeur and the tragedy of human existence. “Through your will” expresses the grandeur of man … “As if”—that is the tragic limitation, for nothing essential in the external world really depends on this individual action. It will not change the world, still less other men …’.
One of the sourest discords between what Goldmann finds here in Kant’s idealism, and the Marxist onward march in terms of which he interprets it, lies in the consideration that in practice few movements in history can have been less disposed to ‘futile’ or ‘Utopian’ Kantian gestures than Marxist movements have been.

A Theory of Justice, by John Rawls
“Justice is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought,” Rawls writes at the beginning of this most remarkable book.1 The sentence contains the seeds of a lot that is to follow. A social system may have many other properties that we can recognise as advantages—as that many people are content or getting what they want, or that a class of outstanding artists is supported—but without justice it is not acceptable. There are many social values, but they can be ordered: and justice comes first. Justice itself, moreover, is various: both in the sense that there can be various conceptions of justice, several of which Rawls very carefully explores, and also in the sense that the conception of justice which he favours, which he calls ‘justice as fairness,’ itself embraces more than one principle, and these principles are themselves ordered, with a scale or precedence rationally determined between them.
I pick on this matter of the ordering of social principles first, because it is an outstanding feature of the kind of system that Rawls has produced, and also one which makes this very long and densely argued book, not merely a great achievement of intelligence and moral reflection, which it certainly is, but also notably heartening. It is heartening because it not only promises, but concretely presents, a systematic body of thought about the principles which should govern society, in a manner which manages to be at once complete and humane enough to satisfy moral demands, and rigorously unified enough to meet the rational requirements of one who wants more than disconnected insights. Up to now the main streams of reflective thought about social ends have tended, with the exception of Marxism, to flow into one of two channels. They have been in some cases pluralistic (the kind of outlook which Rawls, making an individual but very pointful use of a traditional term of moral philosophy, calls ‘intuitionist’): these believe that there is more than one independent social value, and that there can be no general and systematic way of ordering priorities between them—each case or type of case has to be viewed in itself, and some compromise contrived, between fairness and growth, for instance, or liberty and efficiency. To this the more rational and ordered alternative has seemed to be uniquely utilitarianism, which promises to reduce all social values to one: to some variant or another of the ‘greatest happiness of the greatest number.’ Since this aim is exceedingly obscure, both for empirical reasons and because the central concepts are very fishy, utilitarian calculation is muffled by pluralism, common-sense and half-heartedness, which is doubtless a mercy, since its unrestricted consequences, especially for justice, can be seen to be alarming. Nevertheless utilitarian patterns of thought carry great rational prestige, not only for social or economic reasons, but because it has often seemed to embody rational and systematic social thought as against the disconnected reflexes of prejudice or habit.
What Rawls has produced is an elaborate system of thoughts on social principles and the demands of justice in society, which can be put alongside utilitarianism in terms of providing a rational ordering of priorities, and yet, being founded on the central role of justice rather than utility, preserves values which have been emphasised by pluralists queasy of utilitarianism’s willingness to sacrifice rights to efficiency. Any such enterprise, obviously, must make its basic moves at a level of high generality; to suppose otherwise would be to misunderstand the nature of the enterprise, and certainly utilitarianism could make no reproach to Rawls on this score. But Rawls does not remain merely at such a level, and the second part of his book contains sensitive and careful reflection on such subjects as civil disobedience and the rights of conscientious objection. In fact—and it is a point remarked by Rawls himself—his method allows more specific conclusions to be reached by philosophical or theoretical means than does utilitarianism. For the utilitarian, almost everything really depends on empirical facts, since he only has the one principle and everything else depends on how satisfactions will empirically work out; while for Rawls more specific considerations are worked into the basic principles themselves and there is correspondingly more ground that can be covered by reflection at the level of principle.
Rawls has two basic principles of justice. The first—and it is the first, having priority of application—is that “each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all.” The second principle, in its final form, is that social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged, and attached to offices and positions which are open to all under equality of opportunity: allowance being made by what is called the “just savings principle” or responsibilities towards the future (here, as elsewhere, Rawls deals very sharply and sensitively with matters which have been the concern of economic theory, and he returns to a great tradition of Mill and Sidgwick in joining these concerns with those of moral philosophy). The general conception of the two principles of justice taken together is this: “All social primary goods—liberty and opportunity, income and wealth, and the bases of self-respect—are to be distributed equally unless an unequal distribution of any or all of these goods is to the advantage of the least favoured.”
Rawls offers an elaborate set of arguments in explanation and defence of these as the fundamental principles of justice. His arguments are designed to unfold their content, which turns out to be less obvious than one might have first expected; to compare them with alternative embodiments of justice, and also to compare different interpretations which can be given of these principles themselves; and to justify them, in the sense at least of showing that they satisfy certain basic moral opinions or intuitions which his readers may be expected to share with him. Whether the arguments are meant to justify the principles in a sense yet stronger than that, as for instance by showing that they should, or very plausibly should, be assented to by any rational agent—where ‘rational’ is not taken as already importing a suitable range of moral opinions—that is something that I am less than clear about. Why I am unclear about it will perhaps come out better if I look first at the role of the very striking model which Rawls uses to ground and explicate his system, the model of the ‘original position.’
Rawls belongs to the tradition of contract theorists of society, and particularly associates himself with the later and more explicitly moralised version of the contractual model, as it is to be found above all in Rousseau, and also in Kant, the moralist whose influence is most evident in this book.
Rawls of course makes no appeal to any historical or actual contract as underlying society, nor (if I follow him) does he appeal to the idea of a contract in justification of allegiance to the state; as in Rousseau, it is not some tacit consent to a supposed contract which commands allegiance, but rather the moral properties of society, which properties can best be laid bare in the model or analogy of a contract. Rawls’s model is of a set of persons settling jointly on a set of social principles and institutions to which they and their descendants will then be committed. They are to be pictured as making this choice under a certain set of conditions: apart from standing features of their initial situation, as that their powers are limited and roughly equal, scarcity a real but not overwhelming factor, and so on, they are to be understood as making their choice in accordance with certain principles: that their choice is to be in universal terms (that is to say, will apply to everyone), and does not mention any particular persons as, for instance, beneficiaries of the outcome; that the rules and institutions agreed on will be public, and known to all participants (this prevents, among other things, a cynical take-over bid from utilitarians, who often claim that any system which is ultimately best for everybody must really be utilitarian, even if its content is not); and that the choice will be binding and unchangeable. Above all, this imagined choice is pictured as occurring behind a ‘veil of ignorance’ as Rawls calls it: the parties in the original position—as this set-up is called—are pictured as ignorant of their own identities, history, and character, even, indeed, of their own tastes or preferences; though they are to be allowed knowledge of general empirical principles (a departure from total Kantian purity which Rawls is at some pains to justify). Most significantly of all—and this is the central point of the veil of ignorance idea—they do not know what position they will occupy in the social set-up which they are collectively to decide upon. It is Rawls’s claim that in the circumstances imagined, what a rational man would decide upon is a set of institutions arranged on the basis of the two principles of justice he has formulated.
In this light, in particular, we understand the emphasis that those principles put upon the idea that inequalities are to be justified only if they are to the benefit of the least advantaged: the maximin principle, as it is called, of considering each possible set-up from the point of view of the worst-off in each one, and choosing that one in which the worst-off are better off than the worst-off in any other set-up. This emphasis is extremely important in Rawls’s system, and it is one of the things that markedly distinguishes his outlook from that of utilitarian procedures (a point which is rendered absolutely precise in Rawls’s treatment). If you run a risk, behind the veil of ignorance, of ending up in the worst position in the eventual outcome, and you do not even know how big that risk is, it indeed seems rational to make sure, very high among your priorities, that the worst offered in the outcome should be as good as possible.
So Rawls argues. But the first, if not the most basic, question that his treatment suggests is whether that is necessarily rational; or rather, perhaps, granted how underinformed the persons in the original position are, whether we, or they, have enough to decide what is rational. A man who chooses a system in which there is a risk of degraded slavery, but also a chance of tremendous power and prestige, is not evidently more irrational than one who opts for some more Attlee-like alternative—he just has a different temperament. In order to try to block this objection, Rawls cuts his persons off from a lot of basic information about the chances of ending up in one situation rather than another, and also (as I have said) about their own talents and temperament. But then the question arises, of whether in cutting them off from everything that could give a rational edge to the gambler’s approach, he has not cut them off from so much as to make the whole model unintelligible. Rawls tackles the problems of trying to give his hypothetical parties enough information to make the exercise comprehensible, but not too much: there remains a real doubt about whether he has succeeded.
There is one set of theorists to whom Rawls will perhaps have little to say. Rawls’s model of the original position is a striking monument to something which contract-theorists and (in this respect) utilitarians have in common, the belief that particular historical situations enter into political and social calculation only secondarily, along with particular empirical information about the wants and interests of the persons involved. Thus Rawls’s parties are pictured in total abstraction from history, equipped like their Lockean and Rousseauite predecessors only with the draughty coverings of rationality and (perhaps) morality. This presents certain internal difficulties for Rawls’s system: thus I think he is committed to talking about social classes at a stage in the proceedings where he has not provided any conditions for picking out a class as opposed to any arbitrary set of persons within society: what constitutes a class, and a class-interest, is a question that cannot be answered at the level of abstraction from history that Rawls seems to require. Nevertheless, those of us who have felt rather hopelessly that only an untidy pluralism could get anywhere near the complexities of social value must be led to wonder whether what they took for an insightful pessimism may not have been in some part just laziness. Utilitarians, again, will have to salute someone skilled in economic and systematic thought, with a genuinely alternative view. Others of us who may still feel that there is something dauntingly and unrealistically pure about the Kantian principles which Rawls employs, must recognise the extent to which Rawls’s work has raised the level of what is to be expected of any alternative picture. Like all notable philosophical achievements, it will change the basis of discussion over a large area for a long time to come.2

Beyond Freedom and Dignity, by B. F. Skinner
B. F. Skinner is an American psychologist who is famous for a number of things. He pioneered a particular kind of behaviourist theory, based on the idea of selectively reinforcing by reward certain spontaneously produced patterns of behaviour: the model for learning is thus fundamentally that of evolutionary natural selection. He conducted a famous series of experiments with pigeons. He invented, among other things, an experimental device called the Skinner Box, which provides a totally artificial environment for the study of animal behaviour. He has written a Utopian novel. He has been extensively attacked by Chomsky, originally on the subject of language acquisition, who argued, extremely convincingly, that Skinner’s theories were totally incapable of explaining the learning of language; this controversy extended, no doubt with some help from Chomsky’s own political concerns, into larger areas of discontent with the theories, methods, outlook and ethics of the kind of behaviourism of which Skinner is the outstanding representative.
This book is described on the jacket as ‘the summary of his life work in the scientific analysis of behaviour.’1 This it scarcely can be, since it summarises no actual scientific results at all, but it is presumably meant as a summary of what Skinner thinks the results of his life’s work offer for mankind. It is rambling, repetitive, optimistic, rather well written, and dauntingly stupid.
It is a mixture, in about equal proportions, of ninth-rate philosophy, ill-defined values, and non-existent science. The science is non-existent, it is important to emphasise, not just in the sense that it does not here appear on the page; it is not that Skinner has somewhere else demonstrated what he here repeatedly presupposes, namely that there exists a body of scientific work which enables us to explain and control complex human cultural behaviour in terms of his behaviourist reinforcement theory. No such work exists, and there is very little reason to think that it could exist. Because the accounts given here all rely on promissory notes drawn on a behaviourist bank which we have reasons for thinking is bankrupt, Skinner’s supposed technical terminology in which he naively describes human affairs is exactly what he—in a rather hurt tone—denies it is, a jargon. It is just as scientifically worthless, and a good deal less amusing, than Mr Desmond Morris’s attempts to describe human activities in terms drawn directly from the activities of other primates.
Skinner’s main idea is to move our attention from attempts to explain and control individual behaviour by acting directly on the individual, to a concentration on the environment. A myth which he finds a great obstacle to this is that of what he calls ‘autonomous man’—‘the inner man, the homunculus, the possessing demon, the man defended by the literatures of freedom and dignity.’ As will be gathered from these phrases, it is not easy to discover what exactly Skinner means by ‘autonomous man.’ He makes it harder by starting the book with a set of formulations which are perhaps unnecessarily absurd.
The Greeks, we are told, had a physics which ‘personified’ physical things, and which did not work; physics got going when it stopped treating things as persons. We have not made the same step in psychology and the behavioural sciences: we still talk about human behaviour in a ‘pre-scientific’ and ‘personified’ way. That is to say, Skinner’s opinion seems to be that since it was a mistake to treat things as persons, it must be an equal mistake to treat persons as persons, and the sooner we stop the better. The Greeks (it used to be said) tried to explain the behaviour of things in terms of purposes, because they projected on to the world their own purposes. Now it appears, they made a more basic error, of thinking that they had any purposes themselves.
It may be that Skinner does not have to say anything as silly as this: but it is impossible to tell, because he constantly muddles up the questions of whether we are to speak in terms of individual intentions and purposes at all, with the question of whether social arrangements are best designed in terms of individual intentions and purposes.
The latter, at least, he denies: the ‘literatures of freedom and dignity’ have done great harm in insisting on such ideas as individual responsibility, in particular in its emphasis on punishment, which is, among other things, inefficient—‘much time and energy would be saved’ if other methods of controlling behaviour were adopted. Indeed, there is much to be said against punishment, and the myths that go with it; but Skinner has got nowhere at all in saying it, since he does not even consider most of the issues that bear on the matter: for instance, whether there is any kind of value in having methods of social control which persons subject to them can so far as possible rationally understand.
What values will replace the archaic and pre-scientific myths of freedom and dignity? What will the ‘time and energy’ be saved for? ‘For more reinforcing activities,’ we are told: ‘reinforcing,’ it should be said, is Skinnerese for ‘enjoyable’ or just ‘good.’ What these are, is left in the dark: it is perhaps up to us, though that might seem to Skinner to smell too much of autonomous man.
Central chapters on values and culture offer nothing on the central question except the vaguest kind of co-operatively directed evolutionary ethic. More insight into what Skinner would really like emerges in fact from a book much more revealing than this one, his Utopian novel ‘Walden Two,’ in which the community formed by scientific behaviour control is represented. The general tone is that of a particularly mild and genteel Adult Education Centre, with the performing arts and Sunday painting to the fore. In the present book, Skinner for one moment glimpses the possibility that his social technology might make a difference to art, when suffering danger and ‘the struggle to be good’ have been removed. He is unworried: ‘the art and literature of a new culture will be about other things.’
This is not really a malign book, though it is a profoundly obtuse one. Its jaunty jargon is so pathetically removed from any social reality that it could scarcely produce, directly at least, much evil in practice, though the know-all reductive tone may encourage some enemies of freedom and dignity. More theoretically, the pity is that it can only encourage the idea that the values of humanity, and the scientific understanding of human beings, stand necessarily opposed to one another. If Skinner’s reinforcement theory were really the science in question, that would indeed be so; but in fact scientific understanding is no more present in this book than any other kind.

What Computers Can’t Do: A Critique of Artificial Reason, by Hubert L. Dreyfus
Electronic machines of the kind generically called “computers” can now do a number of things at least as well as human beings, and in some cases better. Many of these tasks are boring, such as finding addresses or counting things. Immunity to boredom is one thing that helps to give computers the edge over human beings in some tasks. Another is speed of operation: only a computer could do the calculations necessary for landing a module on the moon, since only a computer could do the sums in less time than it takes the module to get there.
In some cases, the computer’s program guarantees an answer to the problem in hand. Whether this is so depends on several things: first, whether the problem is one for whose solution a determinate procedure (called an algorithm) can be specified. An algorithm is a set of instructions which when carried out is bound eventually to yield what is required. Looking things up in lists and doing addition are two among many tasks for which there exist algorithms, and computers spend most of their time on just such things.
But even if a task can be specified in an algorithm, there remain vitally important questions of whether a machine could complete the task in an acceptable time or within the limits of the amount of information it can process. These restrictions are so important that the question of whether there is an algorithm for a given task may be of little practical interest. Thus, in principle, there could be programs for playing checkers that involved counting out all possible future combinations of moves and countermoves (though even this would not by itself provide the way to choose the best moves). But assuming that at any given point five moves on the average are possible, the number of possibilities twenty moves ahead is greater than the number of microseconds in a year—which forecloses that way of going about it.
For most interesting tasks either there is no algorithm or it is not a practicable one. So machines must be programmed not to grind through the task but to proceed “heuristically”—to search intelligently (as we would put it), to show some insight into what is relevant and promising, and to learn what is useful and what is not. Such programs, of course, are in themselves as determinate as the others, and the machine’s states are still determined by the program and its earlier states: the difference is that the program does not contain instructions which lead inevitably and by exhaustion to a solution, but rather is designed to throw up routines and strategies which should prove fruitful in finding a solution.
In talking of “computers” here I have in mind, as Dreyfus has throughout his book, digital machines, that is to say, machines that represent all the information they handle by combinations of elements each of which can be either of two states (on or off, for instance), and are thus machines which conduct their procedures in a series of discrete steps.1 In saying that a digital machine goes in discrete steps one is saying something about how it represents information; one is not saying that it goes from one physical state to another by instantaneous magic, without going through places in between, but only that the places in between do not have any significance in representing information. When a digital device such as an adding machine is contrasted with an analogue device such as a slide rule, the point is not that one clicks and the other creeps, but that any points that the latter creeps through, however close together, do represent something.
Some still hope, and more fear, that foreseeable developments of these techniques will yield digital machines which over an impressive and growing range of human competence will equal or surpass human ability. In this book Dreyfus aims to refute these expectations and to allay these fears by showing on general philosophical grounds that the aim is impossible and that the research which seeks to develop machine intelligence so that it can solve interesting and really complex problems is doomed to failure, except perhaps in solving some very narrow problems. He starts with the record and claims that there has been over the last fifteen years a repeated pattern of initial minor success, grandiose promises and predictions, then disappointments, diminishing returns, and finally silence as the research bogs down and the promises remain unfulfilled.
Similar patterns can be seen in various fields of computer research. Following Minsky, a leading worker whom he extensively criticizes, Dreyfus distinguishes two main branches of inquiry that have seemed at one time or another very promising. One is Cognitive Simulation (CS), which takes tips from the ways humans actually solve problems and from the short cuts they use, and seeks to provide methods for machines which will significantly reproduce some psychological features of intelligent human behavior in solving mathematical problems, for example, or translating from one language to another. The other, Artificial Intelligence (AI), is, in Minsky’s words,
… an attempt to build intelligent machines without any prejudice toward making the system simple, biological, or humanoid … one might first need experience with working intelligent systems (based if necessary on ad hoc mechanisms) if one were eventually to be able to design more economical schemes. [Quoted by Dreyfus, p. 43]
With both these approaches, initial small successes led to overconfidence: Dreyfus rehearses numerous instances of this. But there is a real question about how significant much of this now aging material is. Even if early predictions of computers’ chess competence were wildly overoptimistic, it really is not very interesting to be told again that a certain chess program was beaten in 1960 by a ten-year-old: it is even less interesting than the fact (a trifle gracelessly admitted by Dreyfus) that more recently a program called MacHack beat Dreyfus.
Artificial Intelligence has gone through a sober process of realizing that human beings are cleverer than it supposed. It has turned to a more cautious and diversified strategy of accumulating “know-how” rather than mounting frontal assaults. These developments—of which one will gather little from Dreyfus—are more appropriate to the sort of phenomenon intelligence is, and the boasts and disappointments which Dreyfus tirelessly rehearses are of decreasing relevance to assessing prospects now.
The more important part of Dreyfus’s case lies not in the references to past history and slow progress, but in the general considerations which, he claims, show that the failures are inevitable and that it is to be expected that relatively trivial initial success will run out when one tries something more complex. The predictions of large success on the basis of small are not just examples of technologists’ euphoria or grant collectors’ publicity, but rely on a principle which is itself fundamental to the kind of analysis that goes into CS and AI, namely that moving from simple to complex is just moving from less to more—that the development of more of the same can be expected, in one way or another, to crack the problem. This principle Dreyfus rejects.
Dreyfus cites a number of features of human experience in problem solving that he claims are essential to problem solving and could not conceivably be reproduced or imitated by a computer. They are all of what might, very loosely, be called a “Gestalt-ish” kind, and include the phenomena of “fringe consciousness” (as when one is dimly aware of the relevance of some ill-defined factor), “zeroing in” (as when a problem-situation “organizes itself around” a promising approach), and tolerance of ambiguity, under which, for example, the mind can succeed in disregarding in a certain context a possible significance of a word which in another context would be the one to present itself. In general, the human mind can seize on what is essential in a given situation and mentally organize the whole problem in the light of this understanding.
It is I, and not Dreyfus, who have assembled this set of requirements for problem solving in such short order, though it must be said that he himself runs through them briskly and successively in his own exposition. But when they are brought together, one gets the first glimpse of a problem which grows throughout Dreyfus’s book, that is, the exact status he assigns to such phenomena. Dreyfus tends to present them as though they were special ways human beings have of going about solving problems, ways not employable by computers but which have to be used if problems are going to be solved. But it is not clear that the requirements are all this, or indeed that they all have any one kind of relevance to problem solving. Thus an ability to distinguish the essential from the inessential does not provide a special way of solving problems, available to humans and lacking to machines: solving a complex problem is itself an exercise in telling the essential from the inessential, and to say that machines cannot do this is not to uncover a deep reason why machines cannot solve that kind of problem, but is just to say that they cannot. Dealing with ambiguity seems to be similar; and it certainly is, if we assume that one aim of the exercise must be to produce machines that can handle natural language.
“Zeroing in,” on the other hand, seems to be of a different, though perhaps rather ambiguous, status. It could just refer to the human ability to arrange the data of a problem in a way conducive to a solution, seeing the relevant ways to use the data, and so on, in which case this ability seems once more logically indistinguishable from an ability to solve the problem, or at least (what is wanted) to solve it economically. But it could, as characterized by Dreyfus, refer to a certain kind of experience, of a Gestalt character, in which the data “turn round” and “structure themselves” and “present themselves” in a relevant way. It is the sort of experience, perhaps, that may be helpful to humans in problem solving. There are many reasons for wondering whether any machine could have an experience of that sort; but also, there are few reasons for supposing that it would have to in order to solve problems.
The confusion here is encouraged, I think, by Dreyfus’s own philosophy, which does the best it can to obliterate distinctions between the problem situation itself and how it seems to the problem solver—a distinction without which the whole issue and some of Dreyfus’s own assertions become unintelligible. He presents certain capacities as at once indispensable to problem solving and inconceivable for the machine. But, on inspection, these items tend to dissolve into some things that are certainly essential to problem solving (as being indeed in various degrees restatements of what problem solving is) but which are not shown to be inconceivable for the machine, and, on the other hand, things of the Gestalt-experience kind that may well be inconceivable for the machine but are not shown to be in themselves essential to problem solving—at least, for machines.
If one lays aside the covert appeal to Gestalt experience, most of Dreyfus’s arguments look thin. He may well be right in claiming that many tasks that are simple for human beings would need systems quite undreamed of in practice for their machine simulation. But his claim to have proved the limitations of computers is exaggerated. If one shakes together the considerations that Dreyfus brings forward, one can extract, I think, three kinds of arguments for his conclusion; and all, it seems to me, leave the issue still open.
First, there is the general “anti-Platonic” argument. This is not so much one argument as a class of considerations, the general upshot of which is that both machine simulations of human skills (such as CS) and machine reproductions by other means of human skills (such as AI) depend on an assumption which is pervasive throughout Western, modern, or at least technological thought, namely, that rationality consists in reducing experience to discrete atomistic elements and handling them by determinate rules of procedure which can be clearly and discursively spelled out.
This assumption Dreyfus repeatedly calls the “Platonic” assumption, thus making a historical claim which it would be tedious to go on about, but which in some of its applications at least is downright amazing; as in the apparent suggestion (pp. 123–124) that Plato had the quasi-technological ambition of reducing the empirical world to determinate rule-governed order—something which the historical Plato repeatedly claimed to be impossible. (Though Dreyfus frequently quotes Heidegger, he does not in this historical connection; but the picture of Western intellectual history of course comes from Heidegger, who holds that Socrates and Plato with their clanging inhuman essences scared off the pre-Socratics, those shepherds of Being.)
Dreyfus contests what he calls the “Platonic” assumption on several planes. At the psychological level, his point seems to be that human beings do not in fact think about things, and could not solve problems, just by a “Platonic” style of step-by-step discursive thought. This seems true, but of doubtful relevance; it may tell against some machine men who claim to be guided by actual psychological data, but beyond that it seems to loop back into the Gestalt-experience consideration. Even when it is the aim of a machine intelligence researcher to construct a program which will solve problems “the way we do,” it cannot be a requirement that the program should have the same sort of shape as our experience of solving problems—indeed, it is not in the least clear what such a requirement would mean. Admittedly—and here Dreyfus makes a good bit of capital—the idea of a machine solving problems “the way we do” is itself very unclear; but, as we shall see, Dreyfus has neglected to look in the obvious direction from which content might be given to that idea.
In any case, for AI researchers the aim is not to get a machine to solve problems “the way we do,” but just to get a machine to solve problems. Against them also Dreyfus applies his “anti-Platonic” argument, on the ground that their assumptions about the possibility of modeling intelligent activity on a digital machine involve the “Platonic” assumption, not this time about the processes of human thought, but about what the world is like and what an explanation or theory about the world, and about intelligent behavior, must be like. A theory about intelligent activity might be “Platonic” without that activity itself being “Platonic,” as the movement of the planets can be described in differential equations without the planets themselves solving differential equations; but, Dreyfus argues, there is no reason to believe that such a theory, which might enable one to model the behavior in a digital machine, is possible, and it is only the “Platonic” assumption that makes people think that it is possible.
The trouble in evaluating Dreyfus’s argument here is that he leaves it unclear exactly how a theory can be said to be “Platonic,” and how strong a restriction on the theory this is. His argument requires at least that any theory which can be modeled in a digital machine is “Platonic”; but he himself mentions the important result that any analogue theory can, if it is sufficiently precise, be modeled in a digital machine as well. He has an argument apparently designed to get round this fact, but I have not been able to understand it. It is not even clear how far round it he wants to get.
Dreyfus’s rejection of the “Platonic” assumption seems to boil down to the usual antimechanist, antiphysicalist, or antideterminist claim that intelligent behavior cannot be scientifically understood, which it will be no surprise to find is rejected by AI researchers. I do not think that Dreyfus wants it just to come down to that, but I have not found enough in his characterization of the “Platonic”—once the Gestalt-experience element is laid aside—to stop it from just coming down to that.
Dreyfus’s second general argument might be called the “all or nothing” or “form of life” argument. The clearest application of this is in the centrally important matter of understanding natural language, and the ability of speakers to cope with a high level of ambiguity, to catch on to what is relevant, and so forth. The sad failure of the project, much vaunted at one time, of constructing programs to translate from one natural language to another has revealed among other things how much information about the world a machine has to have available to it in order to make sense of even very simple human communications; and also how flexible and open-ended the deployment of that information has to be if the computer program, even when it seems to be getting along quite well, is not to collapse into breathtaking idiocy.
Dreyfus rightly emphasizes the importance of this sort of consideration but his treatment of the point is exaggerated. On matters of fact, he fails to acknowledge the extent to which current work on natural language programs shows greatly increased sensitivity to context; and on questions of principle, his treatment tends to distract attention from some of the most interesting questions that might be asked. He claims that the ever-present need of interpretation, and the indefinite range of knowledge and understanding that the human has to call upon, mean that we have to take a human being’s “world” as a whole; Wittgenstein’s celebrated remark about a language being a “form of life” is used here to suggest how much a whole way of being would have to be given to a machine if it were really to deal intelligently with its environment and properly understand what was said to it.
But might not this just be overdoing it? For one thing—to mention an issue which is hardly ever touched on by Dreyfus—even if the human world of understanding has this vast and indivisible complexity, perhaps the intelligent activity of some simpler organism might be adequately simulated? Some of Dreyfus’s other arguments would no doubt aim to exclude that as well; but so far as this argument goes, it is as well to remember that machine intelligence would already have had a vast triumph if it could simulate on any substantial scale the intelligent activity of creatures less culturally elaborated than man.
Another, and more important, point is that Dreyfus’s exclusive insistence on the ways in which human abilities, when all are present and working, are tightly interrelated, and on the extent to which information of different types is brought to bear on interpretative questions in various and plastic ways, distracts attention from the question of the extent to which abilities might be separable from one another, and of the kinds of simplifications which might yield a recognizable fragment of human intelligent behavior. Dreyfus seems, indeed, to think that the idea of such a fragment is nonsense; but we need more than phenomenological descriptions of the experience (or “world”) of the functioning human being to convince us of that. We need detailed theoretical and experimental study of simpler animals and partial abilities, and Dreyfus’s argument, which is all about a world both whole and human, neither proves its impossibility nor anticipates its results.
Dreyfus seems to make the demand that machines, in order to be intelligent at all, should be unfailingly at least as intelligent as human beings sometimes are. That demand is absurd; and, further, there is little reason to believe that the ways in which machines will succeed and fail in displaying intelligence will be just the same as with human beings or other animals. We should expect neither that machines will make no mistakes, nor that their mistakes will necessarily be related in a familiar human way to their successes.
The third general argument, or type of argument, is the “infinite regress” argument, which rests on the idea that the rules or principles of understanding that human beings use need interpretation and that their application is in various ways relative to context. Now rules or principles of a higher order can be used, which determine the application of the ones of a lower rank, and sort contexts into different kinds; but then these rules will themselves need interpretation. If every rule needs another rule, this leads to a vicious regress; it has to be stopped. It cannot be stopped, Dreyfus argues, by an appeal to rules that are intrinsically independent of the context they are to be applied to, or are self-interpreting—there are no such things, and the idea that there are is a fiction of “Platonic” thinkers. Rather, the regress stops, as Wittgenstein (once more) claimed, in certain concrete facts of human life and practice: we do just “go on” in certain ways, “catch on” to some things rather than others; justifications come to an end in a shared form of life.
I find this argument difficult because it is not clear to me what exactly these concrete facts are, and in particular whether they apply to the species as a whole, or culturally differ between societies, to mention only the crudest alternatives—a difficulty which I also have with Wittgenstein’s own account of them. The impression often given by such arguments is that these facts—which no doubt exist—are in some basic way inexplicable: an impression much helped by the very fact that one is given no adequate directions about the level (cultural, psychological, zoological) on which one should look for them, and hence for their explanation. But while facts of this kind no doubt exist, there is no reason at all to expect them to be inexplicable. Until it is made clear why they have to remain inexplicable, it is likely to remain unclear why knowledge of them, or of some weak but adequate version of them, cannot be modeled into a machine.
I have already mentioned Dreyfus’s own philosophy, which provides the basis for some of his criticism, and which he even claims is capable of producing explanations of intelligent and purposive behavior more adequate than any available to “Platonic” theories. The philosophy in question is a type of phenomenology owing much to Heidegger and to Merleau-Ponty. It is not, at least in this offering, very easy to take it seriously, or even patiently. One of its characteristics is its reliance on terms which sound explanatory, but which in fact conceal in their ambiguity many of the real questions that need to be asked:
But what if the work of the central nervous system depends on the locomotive system, or to put it phenomenologically, what if the “higher,” determinate, logical, and detached forms of intelligence are necessarily derived from and guided by global and involved “lower” forms? [Pp. 148–149]
What indeed? “Derived from” and “guided by” here are sheer bluff, and will remain so unless some more “Platonic” work is done.
Another trait—almost definitional of the method—is to offer a graphic, and often pointedly inaccurate, description of a perceived situation which allegedly reveals its nature:
Thus, in ordinary situations, we say we perceive the whole object, even its hidden aspects, because the concealed aspects directly affect our perception. [P. 153]
That contains at least two straightforward falsehoods, and unhelpful ones: to suggest that such characterizations could helpfully replace scientific investigation of why and how things look solid under certain conditions is absurd.
Such untruths have a built-in defense mechanism: they are so obviously untrue that anyone who protests of their literal falsehood can be accused of having missed their nonliteral point. But that mechanism is not enough to keep them alive in a world of hard questions; nor, incidentally, to justify their use by Dreyfus, who earlier in the book has gone in for a great deal of donnish nit-picking against formulations, loose but often adequately intelligible, offered by people on the other side.
Another characteristic feature of phenomenology that deeply affects Dreyfus’s argument is its traditional tendency, despite heroic efforts on the part of its leading exponents, to slide inexorably in the direction of idealism, the view that the world can only be coherently regarded as the-world-as-it-seems-to-us, or, worse still, the-world-as-it-seems-to-me. Dreyfus constantly uses formulae that present the world which men perceive and act in as already constituted by their experiences and perceptions: thus at page 136 he seems to accept that “only in terms of situationally determined relevance are there any facts at all”; and at page 184 writes, “We are at home in the world and can find our way about in it because it is our world produced by us as the context of our pragmatic activity … [our] activity has produced the world.” Even my personal memories are “inscribed in the things around me” (p. 178).
Of course, there are ways of taking these sayings. But it seems that Dreyfus wants to take them in such a way that the whole idea of a scientific theory which regarded the objects of the human world—such as trees, for instance—in abstraction from human interests would be absurd. From that, I am inclined to think, he derives his most general “anti-Platonic” opinions: if the objects of the human world cannot be regarded in abstraction from human perception, activities, and interests, then there can be no scientific account which takes such objects and human beings, and inquires how they interact.
But if that argument is going to work, it looks as though the idealistic premise from which it has to be derived must be taken in an enormously strong and indeed lunatic way. It has to be taken, in fact, in such a form as to imply that, since trees are “produced” and so forth by human interests, a world in which there were no humans would be a world without trees—indeed, it would not be a world at all. If one objects to this, naïvely, by saying that it must be possible for there to be a world without humans, because there used to be a world without humans (including, however, trees), the reply will be that one has misunderstood.
But the use that Dreyfus makes of these idealist formulae for his purposes seems to me precisely to require the crude, indeed laughable, interpretation which he would immediately reject. For if we can conceive of trees without humans, why cannot we scientifically investigate their interactions with humans? If the sense in which the world is “produced” by humans is just the less hectic sense in which the world must be described from a human point of view, why is it impossible that among the things described from that point of view are the causal relations involved in the human perception of trees?
Dreyfus does not, however, surrender everything to the realm of production by human experience; apart from our experience, and really “there” in some sense, is a flux of energy, atomic particles, things as described by physics. Indeed, he admits that man is a physical system interacting like others with his physical environment, and that “inputs of energy of various frequencies are correlated with the same perceptual experience” (p. 95). Moreover, according to Dreyfus, the impossibility of digital simulation is not supposed to exclude the possibility of artificial organisms, if these are conceived of in terms of analogue systems, no doubt embodied in biological materials. But Dreyfus makes these concessions very lightly and clearly regards the levels of physical or neurophysiological explanation, which he is happy to concede, as something quite detached from the possibility, which he rules out, of the simulation of intelligent activity by digital means.
But Dreyfus does not see how much his offhand concessions to science may have cost him. For if we can gain enough physical knowledge to construct an artificial organism, and if construct it is what we do, as opposed to growing it in vitro from ready-made biological materials, then we understand it. And if we understand it so that we can construct it to behave in certain ways, then we understand the relation of its physical structure to its possibilities of behavior, in the sense at least that we understand what kinds of physical differences underlie what kinds of differences in behavior.
Moreover, there is no a priori reason why the possibility of yielding certain behavior should be restricted to structures in one given sort of material; it would rather prove, perhaps, to be indeed the structure of a system which provided the required potentiality. And if we got to that stage, then even if it were an analogue system that we had uncovered, it is unclear why in principle it should be impossible to model it in a digital machine. I see nothing in Dreyfus’s frequent complaints against those who have confused physical and psychological levels that blocks this road to the positions he supposes himself to have cut off. This is the direction in which content can be found for the notion that a machine physically very different from us might solve problems or do other things “as we do.” It also provides the sense—the only interesting sense for these investigations—to the question “How does man, or another animal, produce a given kind of behavior?”
Dreyfus says at one point (p. 144) of the question “How does man produce intelligent behavior?” that
… the notion of “producing” behavior … is already colored by the [Platonic] tradition. For a product must be produced in some way; and if it isn’t produced in some definite way, the only alternative seems to be that it is produced magically.
Well, one ambiguity, rather tediously, has to be removed: of course it isn’t necessary that a given sort of behavior must on every occasion be produced in the same definite way, nor would a machine have to produce it always in the same way. But if the thought is that a given piece of behavior can appear on a given occasion, and not be produced on that occasion in some definite way—then yes, indeed, it would be produced magically. That is the magic Dreyfus is calling us to from his counter-Platonic cavern. But however depressed we may sometimes be by the threats and promises of the machine men, we are not forced in there yet.
