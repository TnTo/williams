Wisdom: Twelve Essays, edited by Renford Bambrough
John Wisdom, who this year retired as professor of philosophy at the University of Oregon, for many years taught at Cambridge. The most important fact of his philosophical life has been the influence of the later Wittgenstein, to which his publications bear strong witness from 1937 onwards; though he had published a number of things before that, including a book, Problems of Mind and Matter, it is as an exponent of Wittgensteinian ideas that he has, perhaps, most generally been regarded, and indeed has given the impression, in some of his most influential works, of regarding himself.
It is not an adequate assessment of him, as Renford Bambrough insists in the preface to this book of papers by various authors; and it can be added that if it were, Wisdom’s writings could not now be of much interest.1 When Wisdom wrote his best-known pieces on Wittgensteinian themes, the later work of Wittgenstein was largely unknown, confined to disciples, and transmitted by eager rumour and clandestine notes; but since Wittgenstein’s death in 1951 publication of an extensive nachlass has, if not exactly enabled Wittgenstein to speak for himself (since much of it, seemingly, Wittgenstein did not wish to be heard), at least enabled each of us to cope more directly with the question of what Wittgenstein had to say.
Regarded just as a source, or as a display of Wittgensteinian ideas, Wisdom’s work was in any case always stylistically too idiosyncratic; and the publication of Wittgenstein’s work, again, does not help, since if one is forced to a comparison of these two ways of writing philosophy in a style without exposition or the apparatus of proof, Wisdom’s jokiness runs the risk of coming out of it as English things do from some other comparisons with Viennese things (music, for instance). Quite apart from Wittengensteinian comparisons, Wisdom’s style is rather perilous; at its most extreme, in the remarkable series of articles Other Minds (reprinted in a book of that name), though often it can be funny and revealing, it runs risks of being coy or facetious or resonantly vague—signs of strain, I suspect, generated by the difficulties in Wisdom’s basic philosophical enterprise of accommodating to one another imagination, common sense, and what was in its origins a strongly positivist theory of knowledge.
Wisdom developed his philosophy in a climate in which positivism and logical empiricism were particularly lively influences, and while his work can be seen as a reaction against or move away from positivism, with its view of science as a summary of observations, its sharp distinction between verbal and factual truth, its verificationist view of meaning, nevertheless positivism recognizably shaped its interests. Positivism condemned metaphysical remarks as meaningless: Wisdom expounds kinds of meaning for them, which consist in their being paradoxically illuminating or reminding us of overlooked truths by saying what is literally absurd, or using words in a way which makes us see things which some theoretical obsession has obscured. Such an approach leaves a place for the imagination, and also a role for philosophy, which will at the very least always find some balance that needs redressing, some exaggeration that demands a counter-reminder. He has also stressed those forms of human rationality which were of least interest to positivism’s scientific outlook, such as those deployed in legal argument, the comparison of one case with another.
Yet for all that, this philosophy seems to share with positivism a view that, whatever the value of philosophy, it is certainly something quite special, different in particular from the sciences: the idea that philosophy could be continuous with other activities, and that there can be no special problem about the meaning of philosophical propositions as such, remain equally remote from both outlooks, and in the same direction. That impression is strengthened by the nature of the role that Wisdom found for philosophical remarks, which was peculiarly protreptic: their meaning had to be explained in terms of their ability to make us see things differently, and in this they stood in important and explanatory contrast to some class of factual propositions whose meaning lay more directly in how they related to the world.
There is also the issue of scepticism. Positivism, like all forms of empiricism, centred itself on the theory of knowledge, and had a series of encounters with skepticism; its task was to find the warrant in sense perception for various kinds of supposed knowledge, and where that warrant seemed to be defective, the evidence not to reach up to the conclusions; there was a sceptical vacuum. Wisdom has himself constantly returned to issues about scepticism, in particular scepticism about other minds, the worrying doubt that we do not really know that anyone else has experiences. He has patiently circled round and round this issue, and has given ingenious and memorable help with it. He has resisted positivist, as all other, theories.
But the problem is set for him in a quite positivist way. One moderately primitive answer that might be given to the question of how we know that other people have experiences is that it is an empirical hypothesis which explains very well how they behave. When we are disposed to give this answer, Wisdom discourages us by saying that our belief cannot be an inductive analogical argument, an extrapolation from observed instances: for if it were, it could not (if adequate) be based on just one case, and moreover there would have to be independent verification of the conclusion, which is here in principle impossible. But the assumption that an empirical hypothesis would have to be based on such an argument and satisfy these conditions, is the straight positivist assumption that empirical explanation depends on inductive generalization, which work in the philosophy of science gives us no reason to accept. It is interesting that the exposition of Wisdom’s philosophy by Gasking which forms the first chapter of the present book (the only piece to have appeared before, and now twenty years old) itself takes the inductivist and verificationist assumptions so totally for granted that in its formal setting out of Wisdom’s argument they do not even appear as a separate premiss, but are presupposed in the conclusion.
In tone, Wisdom’s philosophy is not at all like that of positivist philosophers. It gained its complex allusiveness and rejection of explicit doctrine from the later Wittgenstein. It acquired from another Cambridge source, G. E. Moore, a belief in the plainness of certain plain facts and in the oddness of philosophers’ professing to doubt those facts—the weirdness, in general, of philosophical scepticism. Wisdom does not just reject that scepticism, he seeks to interpret it, explain it, see its illuminations. But while we should be sympathetic, grateful indeed, to sceptical aberrations, he will not let us forget, or at least for too long, that they are aberrations.
This approach does well to remind us that, and how, metaphysical remarks are not merely some additional remarks about how the world is, to be treated flatly like other putative additions to our knowledge. But it has the disadvantage, in particular, of making all forms of philosophical scepticism seem basically the same, and implying that the patient, sympathetic, diagnostic and possibly grateful attitude which is obviously the best that can be expected by some forms (such as scepticism about the material world, or the past, or other people’s pains) is equally appropriate to others (such as scepticism about free will, or morality) which not only have a quite different claim on our attention but might actually be right. “Philosophy is the conflict of the obvious with the obvious”, Mr Bambrough writes here; but the idea that the world may be in certain very important respects altogether different from what it seems is both sound and an important motivation to serious philosophy.
It has been said that all of Wisdom’s philosophy is about what philosophy is. Though his best single piece (“Metaphysics and Verification”, 1938) is about philosophy, the claim is in general not true: as witness the series about other minds which, despite many dicta about philosophy, is certainly about knowledge of other minds. Yet, for all that, there is reason behind the false claim. Wisdom’s underlying outlook provides no direct way of addressing oneself to a philosophical view, or just arguing with it: one diagnoses it, or sees it as helpful, or illuminating, or misleading, and those attitudes are higher-order in a way in which to say of a view that it is true or false is not, except formally: to say that a view is true is to say that things are so, to say than a view is illuminating or helpful is not—it is nearer to saying something about those who hear it.
The tendency of the Wisdomian method to lead discussions back to the nature of philosophy is manifested in a few of the pieces in this book. The book is in effect a Festschrift, with some pieces about Wisdom, others about topics in or near his interests. It has the faults of the genre: there is a good deal of overlap, some central subjects get left out (surprisingly, there is nothing on Wisdom’s concern with psychoanalysis), there is no criticism of Wisdom at all, and the pieces are of very uneven merit. Among the good ones, M. R. Ayers refreshingly introduces broader theoretical perspective, in relating some Wisdomian considerations to Chomsky’s views; and Keith Gunderson says some very interesting things about physicalism, and even, since he can write well, earns a place for his jokes. Judith Jarvis Thompson contributes not only a paper but the frontispiece; her paper is good, but her fond photograph of Wisdom is a masterpiece.

The Socialist Idea, edited by Stuart Hampshire and L. Kolakowski
What is socialist thought? It is the attempt to work out systematically the consequences of the three revolutionary values of 1789, in the context of a world transformed by industrialism and capitalism. It is in effect the only systematic political thought we have. Most of the alternatives really come, in one way or another, to saying that there can be no systematic thought at all about the realisation of political values. There has been in the past intellectually elaborated conservative thought, but there is not much of it around today; while nationalism, when it comes to express its further hopes for society, has few of its own terms in which to do so: more often than not, it turns to something it calls ‘socialism.’
Socialist thought displays divergent varieties and manifest tensions. This is hardly surprising: its problems are due, not so much to a special weakness of socialism, as to the difficulty of any political thought which aims to be at once ambitious, coherent, and realistic.
The tensions are certainly daunting enough. The demands for equality, justice, rationality in the deployment of resources, and the harnessing of industrial power to give material elbow-room for the free development of personality, point in the direction of centralised power; the need for a sense of control over one’s environment, liberty in work, a decrease of alienation, and a greater sense of community, point to decentralised power, industrial democracy, and possibly syndicalist solutions. (It is a good thing that Tony Benn reminds us of these various aims; it is less good that he supposes that by looking zealous enough he can make the evident conflicts among them go away.)
Again, there is no reason to think that industrial democracy could increase anyone’s freedom outside institutions of a wider political democracy, nor has anything proved better than parliamentary democracy in guarding the most elementary freedoms. Yet it would be idiotic to deny the doubts inspired by the gap between its pretensions and reality. Parliamentary democracy claims not just to manage society, but to embody and provide freedom, but it is in the area of that value, let alone in that of equality, that its response is found by many to be thin.
The present book is a collection of papers which explores, unevenly but with some real success, these and other such tensions, and the prospects for socialist thought.1 It grew out of a conference held at Reading University in 1973: the title, ‘What Is Wrong with the Socialist Idea?’ was later changed, by a revision worthy of a Fabian drafting committee, to ‘Is there Anything Wrong with the Socialist Idea?’ That original note of discouragement is not altogether absent from the volume; and the collection is set off rather powerfully, in fact, in that direction since a piece which is both the first and one of the most powerfully presented, by Leszek Kolakowski, offers reflections which are discouraged at a deep level. The point and power of socialism in the form of a (humanistic) Marxism, he argues, lay in an idea of the restoration, or perhaps the first creation, of a human self-identity, a wholeness of human personality, not attainable under existing social and economic formations and this idea he is disposed now to see as a myth, simplistic, Rousseauite and dangerous.
Kolakowski’s background (a leading exponent of critical Marxism, he was expelled from Poland in 1968) does not permit triumphant remarks from non-Marxists; and certainly there is no room for condescension from those of us who work for social democratic improvements and just postpone, or take for granted, the question of what picture of human life might be served by the society within which those improvements are defined. Yet, the modest degree of encouragement which Kolakowski permits himself in his introduction might receive a certain impetus from a tradition originally more sceptical: he offers as almost an anti-socialist admission the truism that not all human values can be rendered compatible, but that truism, true as it undoubtedly is, means a defeat only to the most optimistic kinds of socialism—to others, it helps to define the task.
The shadow of socialism as it has developed in Eastern Europe hangs heavily over quite a lot of this book. Practically no one has much to say for it and several Eastern European writers have impressive things to say against it. Mario Nuti finds himself more or less alone in his perception of Eastern European societies as at least farther on the way to genuine socialism and freedom than mixed Western societies, a position in which he finds mysteriously comforting the idea that, the party managers not being in Marxist terms a class, the exploitation of the workers ‘will … not be a class exploitation, and their condition will be capable of being redressed by a “cultural” revolution….’ I should have liked to hear him discuss that proposition with Kolakowski.
Despite the critique of the Eastern party bureaucracies, however, this book is refreshingly free from the old, and typically British, idea that Marxist and non-Marxist strains of socialism have nothing to say to each other. There is only a small amount of biblical exegesis of Marx; at the same time, even those writers who make least use of strictly Marxist doctrine show themselves sensitive to the effects of Marxist ideas in the present situation: so Richard Lowenthal, in a beautifully set out and clear-headed piece on the future of socialism in the advanced democracies.
One form that the old idea of the separation of Marxist from non-Marxist traditions has taken, again typically in Britain, is the very general form of saying that non-Marxist socialism can be metaphysically pure, free from broad world-pictures, as Marxism cannot. This view must surely contain more falsehood than truth. To the important, and difficult, job of establishing their proportions this volume gives some help, if only intermittently; Charles Taylor, in particular, brilliantly argues that an ideology of an ‘expressive’ rather than an ‘instrumentalist’ kind, is what is needed to make sense of any form of socialism faced with late capitalism.
Stuart Hampshire, on the other hand, is disposed to see the dependence of much socialism on general pictures of man as a weakness; and argues, discouragingly, for both the necessity and the non-existence of detailed social scientific knowledge to govern political planning. But—apart from the question of whether there could be such pure knowledge—there is the vital issue of who, how, and with what authority, would apply such knowledge in planning whom: that is also an issue of which the socialist tradition is, happily, aware.

Anarchy, State, and Utopia, by Robert Nozick
Why is there a state at all? Or, rather, why should there be a state at all? What is the justification of the state? The sense that these are real questions has come and gone and come again at various times; when that sense is present, the questions step in as the basic or first questions of political philosophy. It is not obvious that they are real questions, that the demand for a justification is a sound one. For one thing, one might be prepared to spend time on the justification only if one had an idea of some alternative to the state, and it is reasonable to feel that there are, at least now, no real candidates for that.
Differently, one may reflect that thoughts about justification could get a grip only if there were some set of principles or values which were sufficiently independent of the state (in general) to give one some leverage on the question. If the ideas by means of which the state is to be levered into or out of the arena of acceptability themselves presuppose the state, we shall effect nothing. But some, with Hegel somewhere behind them, will feel that there is fair doubt on that score—the moral ideas which supposedly provide the leverage will seem to them not only to be the historical product of the state (which is certainly true, but may not be damaging), but also, in some damaging sense, to get their life from the context of the state. This last group of doubters have also their Marxist relatives, who can, dimly, discern a better world without the state—it is, after all, what the revolutionary process should eventually lead to—but who regard present moralizing about the existence of the state as footling, and ideologically polluted.
Doubters of these last kinds are not going to be reassured by Robert Nozick’s original, remarkable, and strikingly intelligent book.1 He has nothing directly to say to their worries, though they should have things to learn from various of his arguments, and they should at least be forced by this energetic and inventive undertaking to put their claims in a clearer and better-argued form. As should anyone who wants to think effectively both about the existence of the state, and about what goes on in the state: for Mr Nozick not only revives the exercise of justifying the state, but comes out with some startlingly unfashionable conclusions about what it should be up to—or at least, what it should ideally be up to. This qualification, I shall suggest at the end, is of huge importance: the “ideally” is the clue to why Mr Nozick’s book is not what it seems, nor (still less) what some unsavoury people will, with some encouragement from the author, undoubtedly take it to be.
Mr Nozick goes back to the traditional business of justifying the state from the ground up, the ground being provided by an imaginary set of circumstances in which there is no state; this is called by Mr Nozick, as by the tradition, the State of Nature. This, in his presentation, helps us to understand what the state is being justified against: drawing on some particularly American elements in the anarchist tradition, he spends much more time and ingenuity than anyone else has ever done in spelling out how things might go in a partly moralized State of Nature, where various private “protective associations” do the job, for a fee, of protecting people’s rights of life, property, and so on, against force and fraud. It is partly moralized in the sense that the people in it do, for a good bit of the time, but not unfailingly, abide by moral considerations, where these are identified by Mr Nozick with a hardcore set of notions about rights, linked rather loosely with Kantian ideas about treating people as ends and not purely as means. (Utilitarians, of course, will not accept the moral starting-point: Mr Nozick assumes, I think reasonably, that no one with whom it is worth having the argument of this book will be a Utilitarian (really), and he makes on the way some excellent remarks to encourage people to realize that they are not.)
In taking the partly moralized starting-point, Mr Nozick is in line with Locke (an author to whom he closely, and surprisingly often, refers back). More explicitly free, of course, than Locke from any historical implications of the model, he differs more deeply by excluding any idea of a contract: this is State-of-Nature theory without the social contract. In its place, he aims to derive the state from the starting-point of the model by a chain of events which involve no intentional intervention: by what he calls an invisible hand mechanism, adopting in this the language of classical economics, which alone of the social sciences is used in the book and whose methods provide some important parts of its intellectual structure. The mechanism which eventually, and after some pretty densely presented speculations, delivers the state without anyone intending it embodies an important idea of Schelling’s in decision theory (and has some similarity to David Lewis’s recent work on convention). It is an elegant idea to apply to classical State-of-Nature theory a mechanism by which one can arrive at a convention without (so to speak) holding one.
The state which is delivered is, as once more with Locke, the minimum “night-watchman” state of classical liberal theory, doing no more than protect its citizens from force and fraud and such like, leaving them free to pursue their individual projects. Mr Nozick shares Locke’s distaste for taxation, and there is a tough-minded economic argument to represent it as a form of forced labour (though I must warn the CBI [Confederation of British Industry], before they prematurely rejoice over this liberating intellectual event, that we shall see that the consequences of all this for things as they are are very far from clear). Traditional State-of-Nature theorists, in justifying the state, inevitably justified a state of one kind rather than another, with one set rather than another of powers and restrictions: that was a main point of the exercise. Mr Nozick is no exception, and the argument in the first part of the book, which justifies against the anarchists the existence of the minimal state, is followed by a second part (as ingeniously argued, but more relaxedly written) which claims against socialists, nationalists, and indeed most people that the minimum state is the most that can be justified, and that more ambitious moral claims for the role of the state, in particular to produce justice by redistributive measures, are mistaken. Such powers, which are of course claimed in varying degrees by all modern states, have, according to Mr Nozick, no moral basis and offend against people’s individual rights.
The major effort in the second half of the book is the attempt to argue against conceptions of justice (in particular, but not exclusively, that of John Rawls) that yield redistributive conclusions, and to give another conception, which does not: we shall come back to it later. The book ends with an engaging sketch of a pluralistic, libertarian Utopia, which has the unusual property of really carrying through the libertarian ideal by not laying it down even that people should live in a libertarian manner. The libertarian arrangements exist at the higher-order level of permitting a large number of very various communities between which people may move—they are all ordered within the merely Lockean framework, but in themselves they may be as restrictive or unpermissive as you (or rather they) like. Some of the difficulties which might spring to mind about these arrangements are rather disarmingly foreseen.
There is also, it should be mentioned, a bravura short chapter in which it is argued that the modern state might, after all, be justified (that is, in Mr Nozick’s terms, could come into existence without violating anyone’s rights). However, the squeamish reader should be warned against pressing this argument against the general tenor of Mr Nozick’s conclusions. For the construction proceeds via everyone’s selling himself into slavery; and while Mr Nozick himself, more permissive here than Locke, thinks that everyone has the moral right to do this, and hence that the results of it are not for that reason impermissible, it is typical of this structurally sophisticated and self-aware book that the reader should find himself in an ironical stand-off with Mr Nozick on this way of getting to the modern state.
The two major parts of the book, the minimally positive and the ambitiously negative, are connected with each other in more than one way. The aim of the second part is to show that no larger state is justified, by removing what Mr Nozick takes to be the major moral arguments in favour of such a state, namely arguments from distributive justice (only the larger state can be in a position to redistribute, in the interest of what mistaken theories take to be justice). Other arguments, and indeed other moral arguments, might be thought of to support the state. But Mr Nozick is interested only in a relatively narrow range even of moral considerations: those, roughly, to do with rights, justice and the crossing of one person’s “moral boundaries” by another. It is this which dictates the narrow compass of what he thinks has to be said about the more ambitious state; equally, it controls the construction of the minimal state.
Now there is an argument for using the absolute minimum of hardcore moral notions in the first part of the book in the justification of the minimal state. For here one is arguing with someone like the libertarian anarchist, whose ideas these are, and the shape of the argument is to say: “Look, even with those (few) moral ideas one can get to the state” (though of course the rest of us, neither libertarian anarchists nor very tempted by them, might say right at the beginning that the anarchists’ bag of moral ideas was too small anyway, and that we saw no interest in trying to cram that morally elaborated item, the state, into it). But, even if one is prepared to defend the state against them on the strength of this moral hard-tack, one is not bound to say that this is all the argument, even of a moral character, that can be brought to bear on the state; nor, correspondingly, are we bound to think that the only defence of the more elaborate state is to be found in applications of those, or closely related, notions. We might think that there were other values besides justice which the more elaborated state alone could advance: and that there was nothing in the intuitions employed in the first part of the book which will exclude these other values being weighed in the evaluation of the state. Mr Nozick’s defence of his negative claim, that the more elaborate state is not justified, is inevitably weakened by the restrictions imposed on the range of arguments which he considers in favour of such a state.
Not just the second part of the book, but the first part as well, would be weakened if it could be shown that even the hardcore values, the minimal moral package of notions about rights, derived some essential support from sources outside the limited repertoire of the State of Nature (one form of that view, of course, would be held by those theorists I mentioned at the beginning, who think that in one way or another the minimal moral notions themselves derive their life from the state—indeed, from the elaborated state). Locke’s treatment has often been criticized on that score; Mr Nozick’s sophisticated reversion to Locke collects sophisticated versions of the criticisms, and it is surprising he has not done more to head them off.
In particular, he has tried—using, obviously, much ingenuity in the attempt—to get to his destination while avoiding any general discussion of a notion central to his views: property. He does have something to say about Locke’s requirement that, when those in the State of Nature acquire things, there should be “enough and as good left over” for others. But, apart from that (which presents certain special problems for his theory of entitlement), he does not really address himself to the issue of what is an originally just holding at all, or of property as (what he requires) a purely moral notion. Hence, while there is a great deal in the discussion of the State of Nature about people’s “boundaries” and how they get crossed, there is no discussion of where their boundaries are, or of how they get drawn. There is thus a persistent doubt about whether the State of Nature can really be got off the ground without taking for granted conventions and institutions of a kind which the State of Nature does not itself provide. Certainly we cannot hope to get clear about this just by using such intuitions as we have as things are about non-legal and informal ideas of property—they can too readily be seen as extensions of more institutionalized notions.
Another difficulty with the State-of-Nature argument is what its rules are. Mr Nozick reckons to have succeeded in his task against the libertarian anarchist if an invisible-hand mechanism would produce the state without violating anyone’s rights, granted that the individuals are (partly) moralized. But there is an obscurity about why this thought-experiment operates as it does (why, one might equally say, this is the thought-experiment). Mr Nozick presents us with a set of persons who behave like economic men, but within the side-constraints, for the most part, of minimal morality; only “for the most part”, since a lot of the machinery is designed to deal with persons who do violate others’ boundaries, and not all such violations are unintentional. Now the steps in the development of the thought-experiment, though many and complex, are notably unrealistic, if judged from the position of social or psychological credibility. Thus, to take just one of many examples, the protection agencies, which are in economic competition with one another, show a commendable zeal in establishing the rights and wrongs of claims against their clients; but even a modest lack of optimism about human nature would suggest that in fact they would be partial towards their clients, hypocritical towards potential clients, and horrible towards confirmed non-clients.
Now Mr Nozick is not an optimistic idiot who disbelieves this; the point is, these considerations do not count. But why not? What weight is there in the fact that we could, relative to certain wildly idealized psychological assumptions, reach the state without violating anyone’s rights? The motivation seems to be, that the (minimal) state will have been justified if it can be generated by steps each of which satisfies moral demands; and this is taken to mean that we can get there without anyone doing anything wrong. But how is this to be taken? The condition cannot be that we should be able to get there without anyone doing anything wrong at all, since it is a fact that some people sometimes do wrong which essentially contributes to our getting there and helps to power the invisible hand. By the same token, the condition cannot be that there is no wrong whose happening is essential to our getting there. So what exactly is it? How much wrong goes into the model, and where? Why cannot a sceptic resist the invisible-hand derivation, on the ground that its pictured working is too free of wrong to be plausible? As it stands, Mr Nozick seems—though I am not sure of this—to have settled for individuals in the model sometimes doing wrong, but associations not doing wrong; if that is correct, the model seems arbitrary. In any case, the derivation as it stands lacks any evident ground for being precisely as un-Hobbesian as it is.
Still less, of course, does it justify any existing state: for no state arose in this way, and it is Mr Nozick’s thought, certainly in his theory of justice, and I take it here, that how a state of affairs actually arose is crucial for its acceptability. This is the basic idea of his theory of justice as entitlement, and of his criticism of Rawls (and many other conceptions). A holding is just, on this view, if it has been acquired by a just process from a holding which is itself just: at the beginning is a notion of just acquisition (on which, as I have already said, Mr Nozick has notably little to say). Supplementary to the processes of just acquisition and just transfer are processes of rectification for situations which are unjust in one of these respects (holding, or transfer, or previous rectification): and that is all there is of the basic theory of justice.
Mr Nozick makes elegantly clear the difference between such a historical theory of just holdings, and an end-state theory, which concerns itself essentially with the pattern in which holdings end up, and seeks to adjust the pattern to some desired paradigm: Utilitarianism, and egalitarianism, and Rawls’s view are all end-state views. (There is a very nice demonstration that the State-of-Nature model which Rawls uses, that of the Original Position, is so designed that it could only yield an end-state conception of justice.) It will be clear how, at an ideal level of politics at least, Mr Nozick’s conception, as against end-state views, favours a strongly conservative outlook.
What are the intuitive merits of these ideas? There are questions, right at the beginning, about how to argue these issues. Mr Nozick’s basic method, throughout, is to take some everyday, non-political situation about which we are likely to agree, and apply our judgment in it to the larger issue of social principle—a method which, it might be argued, begs the question in his favour, since it presupposes his view that no new moral principles arise (should arise?) with the state. But even running the argument by his rules, his conception of justice does look like an enormous exaggeration of at best one aspect of our moral ideas. It is hard to know how far this is so, in fact, because, once more, we lack any theory of original entitlement. But suppose that, when the Mayflower arrived, some foresighted fellow, crouching by the gang-plank, jumped off and bagged a good area of what is now Massachusetts, before his companions, more cooperative, pious, idle, or enfeebled, got going; it looks as though Mr Nozick, if we assume there were no prior holders, would grant him just title. Do we agree? Would it be unjust to redistribute in favour of those others (even the idle)? Wasn’t it unfair of this man to take advantage of the fact that the others did not spend those crucial moments thinking about property rights? Would a certain fact about the end-result, namely that the nice guys came (nearly) last, have no effect at all on our estimate of the justice of this man’s holdings?
These are questions for Mr Nozick’s theory of justice (and its application to this case); but we can notice more broadly that, even if we eventually agreed that this pushy settler was not to be faulted in justice, that would only underline the point that we could hope that the Pilgrims, and ourselves, would have arrived with more virtues than justice. We are reminded again of that richer range of moral resources (of the kinds of character, for instance, that we want to have in society) which Mr Nozick’s treatment systematically leaves out.
There are other ideas and sentiments relevant to justice, which his treatment also passes over. What advantages, and their rewards, are candidates for redistribution is a real question, which egalitarians should face more honestly than they mostly do; but the fact that we should agree (most of us) with Mr Nozick that compulsory plastic surgery was no just reaction to inequalities in good looks, need not commit us all that quickly to agreeing with him on the evidently different matters of money and power. Again, and near the heart of Mr Nozick’s view, the very matter of distance (in time, over successive transfers, or whatever) does in fact affect the sentiments of many about injustice: the luck of the talented commands more respect, some find, than the luck of those who merely had a talented father. These are also “our” notions, in as good standing, at least, as those to which Mr Nozick appeals, and his conception of justice merely as a pipe for the rightful delivery of rights over any distance is not tested against enough notions to be really persuasive.
This is a book of a very highly theoretical character; indeed its theories themselves have a tendency to pursue the virtues of formal elegance rather than of concrete realism, as witnessed by the presence of much economic theory and virtually no psychology or sociology. This leaves the conclusions rather high in the air, particularly above present political realities. These views leave undetermined to a high degree what should now, in current political practice, be done—to a greater degree than most political theory, including Locke’s; they are in a deep sense Utopian, and the third element in the title is rightly juxtaposed with the others. This is not necessarily a failing: but it should be written in larger letters what the book does not offer. Above all, its theories do not, except in a very general and associative manner, offer any particular comfort to contemporary capitalism. For one thing, contemporary capitalism is a statist enterprise. For another, Mr Nozick’s derivation theory of justice does not imply that contemporary property holdings are just; on the contrary (though it is a matter of unrecoverable fact), it is 99 per cent probable that almost all of them are not. (Mr Nozick may well think that much of America rightfully belongs to Indians.) And in a vitally important but unemphatic passage (page 231) he makes it clear that redistribution by the state may well be, as things are, necessary for the rectification of past injustice. There is little comfort in these pages for contemporary friends of business; but Mr Nozick hardly makes it as clear as he might that this is so.
Within this abstract, complex, clever, and always stimulating, structure there is to be found, one suspects, a robust and romantically creative individualist outlook which, though undoubtedly tough, is in quite a different street from that of the friends of business’s nastier friends. But it will be partly Mr Nozick’s own fault if they, and their enemies, think otherwise.

The Ethics of Fetal Research, by Paul Ramsey
There is a contrast between American and British life which applies not only to politics: while American practice is often harder, tougher and less inhibited than British, so are the protests and analyses that it elicits. Some frontier thought is at work, that before (or after) force all we have is argument, and that one cannot just rely on the rightness of what already exists. Questions of practical ethics take on an urgency, and a sense that something might actually turn on the results of an argument, which are lacking in our own fully saturated culture, with its depressing combination of complacency and dissatisfaction. It is one of several reasons why American philosophy is now a more stimulating, creative and high-class business than British philosophy.
The contrast shows itself in the domain of medical ethics—meaning by that, not the issues of professional propriety about sending in one’s bill and not sleeping with one’s patients, but such questions as abortion, euthanasia, experiments on patients, trust and deceit, and—not least—the institutional morality of medicine and the rights of doctors to make money. In some—not all—of these areas American practice has been less muffled by convention than in Britain (while in the matter of the cash nexus the American medical profession has famously displayed a degree of naked greed which would, at least till recently, have been found ungentlemanly in Britain).
Equally, analytical thought elicited by these questions has begun in America to take off in an energetic manner. It can bring with it, of course, a considerable investment in academic light industry—workshops, institutes, projects. Some of them have deeply suspect pretensions, particularly those which aspire, as some do, to cast the philosopher as ethical consultant, the intellectual chaplain of the terminal ward. Even if there is some coherent intellectual basis for drawing lines between the acceptable and the unacceptable experiment, between the permissible and the impermissible death—and whether there is such a basis at all is a real question—it is certain that the answers cannot be carried into the hospital in the form of the philosophical adviser. If philosophical reflection is to aid practice in such matters, the route will be less direct; but perhaps it would not need to be too long and hard, for all that, since one thing that is clear about these questions is that people need something coherent to believe about them, and any set of reflections that makes some sort of sense of them is likely to get a hearing.
Paul Ramsey is an American theologian who has written a lot on these matters; he is identified with a rather conservative, but not dogmatically extreme, set of positions on them. The Ethics of Fetal Research contains some reflection, some history, and some attempts at clarification, rather than any very strong conclusions, though conclusions can be heard not far off. Its subject is the limits of permissible research on the human foetus, whether in utero, or when separated from the mother, as for instance (but not necessarily) as a result of a decision to abort.1 It is the increase in legal abortion which has brought these problems to the fore. Among other possibilities, abortion can give rise to a foetus which is still living and which can temporarily be kept living, though it is not viable, i e, is not capable of independent life. Some valuable medical results, some of them concerned with the survival of foetuses, can be obtained by experiment on such foetuses, as also on the foetus in utero when it is intended to abort. (As usual, it is not easy to determine to what extent, and with what difficulty, the results might be obtained by other means.) The question arises of what limits should be imposed on research of this sort; and indeed there are questions about what medical uses can properly be made of dead foetuses which are the products of abortion—for instance, whether the mother’s consent has any standing in the case.
In Britain these matters are presently regulated by rules laid down by the Report of the Peel Committee which appeared in May 1972. This report defines a class of pre-viable foetuses; anything too old or too large to be included is, if living, to be regarded as viable, and can only be treated in ways compatible with promoting its survival. There are further restrictions about what can be done even in cases of pre-viability; thus the report rules as unethical any procedure administered to a pregnant woman designed to find out what harm it does to the foetus, even if there is an intention to abort and the woman has given her consent. This fairly conservative document seems, as Professor Ramsey says, to have closed the debate in Britain; in America, however, discussion is still growing, and there has been a series of directives and draft regulations of varying degrees of permissiveness.
There are some interesting questions here on which Professor Ramsey briefly touches, about how such rules should be laid down. In this country a respectable committee led by a well-known non-researching doctor evolved some extensions of established professional practice. In America, equally typically, there is more debate and open intervention by interested groups. But there is a systematic difficulty in all matters of this kind, which has not been discussed enough, about what exactly is a proper interest, in particular a proper moral concern, on the part of the public. Does public opinion have a right to be heard if it is upset about what is going on? Yes, it may be said, if it is informed (if it is not informed, it has a right to speak, of course, but not a right to be heard). But what counts as being informed? Certainly if people were shown on television some of the experiments carried out on foetuses, they would be very upset—but then they would be similarly upset, no doubt, if shown abortions. Here we have the site of the tension that has arisen about the publication of certain aspects of abortion: those opponents of abortion who publish these things are accused of sensationalism, to which they reply that they are showing people what abortion is.
And in saying that, they are not saying anything untrue. The trouble is that a spectator who lacks any context or preparation will not acquire any all-round view of what abortion is. But then where do you hold the line about an informed opinion on foetal research, short of saying that the only persons who have an all-round view of what foetal research is are foetal researchers and their medical colleagues? And with this public opinion disappears again from the scene.
Professor Ramsey comes back repeatedly to the relation between the abortion argument and the question of foetal research, and the central theme of his book is that these are two different issues. Not here discussing abortion itself, he wants to be able to resist those who say to the public: “Since you have already agreed to abortion—a gross, destructive assault on the foetus—it is just irrational to resist much less drastic procedures on it which moreover bring experimental benefits.” He does not aim to make any definitive case against the more drastic forms of foetal research; he does want to say that it is a separate issue from abortion.
He has raised an important and complex issue, and reveals a number of its complexities. It is a pity that, in what often looks like a hastily written book, he has not had greater success in unravelling the muddles. Those who use the tough and very plausible argument which Professor Ramsey confronts will not, I suspect, be moved away from it by this book, though they should be moved to look at the argument again. Professor Ramsey’s treatment is bedevilled by two separate confusions of his own making. The most important question here is: “If you believe that abortion (on social grounds, or at will) is permissible, are you committed thereby to thinking that unrestricted experiment on foetuses (or at least voluntarily aborted foetuses) is permissible?” This question Professor Ramsey fails to concentrate on adequately because he allows himself to be distracted by a different question, which is whether the mere fact that abortion is widely accepted commits us to thinking foetal experimentation is permissible; here the answer is “no”, and Professor Ramsey spends time berating adversaries who (he claims) think two wrongs make a right, rather than directly discussing the question whether either could be wrong if the other were not.
Secondly, in so far as he does take on that question, he tends to take on only a small part of it, making the point that there are moral issues about foetal research which arise even outside voluntary abortion, as for instance with miscarried foetuses. This of course is true, but it still does not answer the main question.
Although Professor Ramsey says that there are two issues, in fact the way he discusses foetal research strongly suggests that, in his view, the desirable restrictions on it properly imply restrictions on abortion. His favoured analogies for the foetus under research are the dying, and—for those not yet, but about to be, aborted—the condemned. Such analogies press very hard on the question of by what right these human beings have been killed or condemned, and it is surely impossible to accept straightforwardly these analogies without more discussion than Professor Ramsey permits himself here of their relation to the abortion issue.
Although Professor Ramsey has not really succeeded in separating these two issues, he may well be right in believing that they can and should be, to some degree, separated. None of the received ways of thinking about these things makes it easy to separate them: neither the Utilitarian way, which makes it all a matter of benefits to mankind, nor the classificatory way, which makes it all a matter of what kind of thing a foetus is. But we have no reason at all to believe that our received ways of thinking about these things are at all adequate to them; we have to invent ways of dealing with them which will fit as honestly as possible with what we know about human nature, what we hope for it, and what we care about in it. Though that is not quite Professor Ramsey’s way of looking at these problems, and though here he seems not to have got things into the order that even he himself wants, his book displays a certain tart humanism and dislike of cant which help to remind us that everything we invent has got to give us not only ways of thinking coherently about these matters, but ways of feeling coherently about them.

The Moral View of Politics
Twenty years ago, the prevailing view in English-speaking philosophical circles was that political philosophy would never flourish again. Now by contrast, the subject is very active, the predicted funeral seems to have been indefinitely postponed, and the sources of this new life are largely to be found in the United States of America.
The moribund condition of political philosophy at that time was due to more than one cause. Some of the causes were internal to the state of philosophy itself; in particular, there was a prevailing theory that statements of value were sharply to be separated from statements of fact or theory, and, in addition, philosophy chastely refused to come out with statements of value. Living political philosophy, moreover, needs a context of political urgency, and the decline of political philosophy in the Fifties and early Sixties was, to that extent, a phenomenon of a period of political stagnation, one which prematurely saluted the end of ideology.
The situation has now changed in all these respects. The harsh theoretical disjunction between fact and value has been modified; the reluctance of philosophers to come out with normative statements is much less apparent; and the political context itself has also changed.
There has been a real revival in political philosophy, and this has been particularly conspicuous in the USA, where the revival of serious political conflict in the later Sixties has, in a traditional manner, helped to revive philosophical political thought. Three sorts of issue in particular contributed to this. The Vietnam war raised questions about the rights and wrongs of warfare; and not only the idea of a just or unjust war, but those very phrases (moving out of the Catholic tradition) came to play an important part in controversy. Because many students faced or feared they would face the draft, the war presented, in a very urgent form, questions about the right of the state to demand service, the duty to obey, and the right to individual conscientious objection: and the rights, equally, to protest by civil disobedience. All of this constituted what might be called the area of rights and allegiance. Second, there is an area of social justice: the application of reflective philosophical theory to moral and social issues presented by the injustices of Western society, assertion of which, in the late 1960s, unsettled conservative belief that those injustices had gone away, and liberal faith that they gradually would do so. This is an area which has produced the outstanding single work of political philosophy since the war, John Rawls’s A Theory of Justice—a work on which Rawls had been working for a long time before recent political developments, though it is by no means unmarked by them. Third, among several other kinds of active social influence, one should mention, in particular, conservationist anxieties, and also the women’s movement, which has given rise to a particularly active philosophical debate about abortion. Both of these influences bear on population policy, and this, in turn, relates back to the issues of social justice; conservation affects future generations, and questions arise about how to think about justice between generations: particularly when, as under policies of population control, the question of what the future generations will be is, in some part, itself a matter of social decision.
In speaking of the impact of these events on philosophy, I have in mind what, in a broad sense, may be called analytical philosophy—philosophy which, while not committed to the restrictive conceptions current in the 1950s, nevertheless shares with them a belief in analytical methods and a discursively argumentative tone. Rawls’s book is in this style, and so is another striking book which I shall come back to, Robert Nozick’s Anarchy, State, and Utopia. It is also the prevailing style of a journal which has succeeded, for several years now, in discussing at a high level a wide range of these problems, a journal called Philosophy and Public Affairs.
This broadly analytical type of philosophical work is intellectually important, interesting in its relation to the development of philosophy, and is certainly influential on public and student opinion, through publications and the work of individual teachers. But a more dramatic influence, it must be said, was shown in the late 1960s by a different style of thought in social philosophy—the kind of post-Marxist critique pursued, to particular, by members of the Frankfurt school who were transplanted to the USA in the 1930s; work which came to much wider and more excitable public notice in the form of Marcuse’s writings, particularly One-Dimensional Man. Some effects of this type of work, and of the events of which it became part, have certainly remained; but the interest in this style of philosophical writing has somewhat receded with the radical movements which it helped to inspire.
One of several ways in which the work of Rawls and Nozick differs from this kind of work is that their values are overwhelmingly of an individual and moral character; the attitudes appropriate to society are seen as extensions of individual moral conviction, and this approach takes, moreover, a rather startlingly pure, non-historical, and unsociological view of the nature of moral conviction, and the role of moral conviction in the determination of what happens in society. In this regard, the works of Rawls and of Nozick are strikingly alike, though they radically disagree in their conclusions.
Rawls’s book, A Theory of Justice, is an elaborate work, which shows very clearly the effects of many years’ discussion and revision. It offers a theory of social justice which is grounded in the moral notion of fairness; its argument proceeds, for a great deal of the book, by working out the consequences of a certain thought-experiment. We are to imagine a set of persons from whom the actual world, their historical and social position in it and their own personal characteristics, are hidden by what Rawls calls a ‘veil of ignorance’. This state of affairs is called the Original Position; in the Original Position, these persons know no particular facts, but do know the general laws of economics and of the social sciences. (It is an interesting reflection on Rawls’s basically Enlightenment outlook, that he assumes that there are such laws which, in principle, can be understood independently of particular facts of history.) In the Original Position, people are to choose a social system for themselves and for their families, and the argument turns on what principles they would rationally employ in doing that. Rawls argues that they would reject Utilitarian principles—for instance, a principle of the highest average welfare: for, after all, when the veil of ignorance was lifted, they might turn out to be among the least advantaged persons in the system, and a high average welfare in that system could still leave them very badly off indeed. Eventually, Rawls argues, they will rationally go for what he calls the Difference Principle, which says (very roughly) that if there are to be departures from equality in welfare, then those departures must be in the interests of the worst-off group.
There has been, and will continue to be, much argument about how Rawls runs his thought-experiment: whether any choice can be made under this degree of ignorance. But the most basic question concerns the force of the thought-experiment itself. Even if a determinate conclusion could be reached about what would be rationally chosen in the Original Position, what would that signify? Well, the answer to this is that it imports a moral conclusion—the self-interested preferences of these abstract agents (insofar as they still have a self) are supposed to be a model for the moral and impartial preferences of actual agents, what actual agents would choose if they were choosing disinterestedly. The basic idea is the very simple one that a fair division of a cake is one you would make if you were selfish but knew nothing about which piece you would get yourself. It is, thus, an approach to social justice which appeals to, and has to be checked against, our moral sentiments. These sentiments, which Rawls standardly calls moral ‘intuitions’, are supposed to be elicited from us rather as the knowledge of our language is: as a linguistic theorist relies on the intuitions of a native speaker about what is an acceptable sentence of his language, so we try out the consequences of moral and social theory on our moral intuitions, and seek to achieve what Rawls calls a ‘reflective equilibrium’ between intuition and theory.
But there is a weakness in this analogy, and in the method it supposedly supports. It is not so much that Rawls is totally resistant to any kind of relativism, though it is notable how utterly untouched his work is by the kind of relativist anxieties which haunt all social philosophy which grows out of sociology and social anthropology, anxieties which surely express, however confusedly, some proper reflexive doubt about whether our current moral priorities can be universally applied. The trouble is, rather more basically, that there is no adequate analogy in the linguistic case for the situation of conflict and disharmony in our moral sentiments, where, necessarily, it matters to us in practice how the conflict is resolved. The relation of such conflicts to moral theory, in Rawls’s sense, is unclear, and the analogy to linguistics which Rawls uses does not really help us to understand it. The moral theory contains consistent and maximally general moral principles, and they, by fitting our intuitions about a large number of cases where there is no conflict, are supposed to acquire the authority to solve the cases where there is a conflict. But how do they acquire this authority?
Here again, the lack of an empirical dimension to Rawls’s thought shows itself. The fact is that we understand too much, in historical and social terms, about the origins of our moral sentiments and about the origins of our conflicts, for us to be able to accept the purely Kantian idea that an abstract structure of principles should, by its harmony and generality, and its ability to fit many of our sentiments, command our allegiance with regard to the sentiments which we are less sure about, and the conflicts in our moral thought which we actually experience.
Now, Rawls’s theory of justice is one which regards justice as a property of outcomes or distributions—you look at the whole pattern of distribution to see whether each person’s holding is a just holding. In this respect, Rawls’s own view is like many other views whose principles are to be rejected in the Original Position, views such as Utilitarianism; they have in common that they all regard justice as a property of the outcome. Robert Nozick, in his book, distinguishes all such theories from what he calls an entitlement theory of justice, where the central question in considering whether someone justly holds something is not what everyone else holds, but how this man came by what he holds; if he justly acquired it from someone who justly held it, then he justly holds it. It is not the resultant pattern, but the legitimacy of each transaction in itself, which should be looked at. Ferociously conservative conclusions can, of course, be drawn from this conception of justice, conclusions opposed to all redistributive mechanisms; and Nozick draws such conclusions, with a good deal of intellectual ingenuity and a certain enthusiasm for upsetting bien-pensant liberals.
Nozick’s theory of justice is only the second part of a book which first discusses—in utterly abstract terms, which make plentiful reference to Locke—the question whether the state is justified at all, and concludes that it is justified, but only in a minimal, nightwatchman form. Taxation, for instance, is regarded as a species of forced labour. What emerges in theory is a utopia which roots itself in an American tradition of libertarian anarchism. What would emerge, in fact, if these ideas gained popularity in the late 20th century, is certainly another matter, and, indeed, Nozick’s relation to contemporary right-wing defenders of capitalism is ambivalent. He is committed to opposing them, both because modern capitalism is essentially statist, and also because holdings in contemporary America are quite certainly, by Nozick’s own standards, unjust (a lot of it was originally stolen from Indians); but his denunciations of redistribution through taxation sound louder than any such considerations. He runs the risk of doing the same as many Goldwaterites, of heading nostalgically for an Old West state of nature, but doing it in a Cadillac.
But, in principle, both his and Rawls’s views are radical: Rawls’s because the Difference Principle is radically redistributive, Nozick’s because it would be a radical change that got us away from redistribution. Rawls and Nozick are quite different in their views of justice, their understanding of the state, and the virtues they salute. But they have much in common. They both approach political philosophy from moral perceptions recovered in intuition (of which Nozick makes much the same use as Rawls does, but he takes and works into theory a different and a narrower range of intuitions). They both regard the enterprise of thinking philosophically about society in abstraction from history or concrete social conditions; and, connectedly, the social sciences they use, Nozick even more than Rawls, are economics and decision theory, both of which can be pursued at a high level of abstraction.
Falling back on such moral perceptions as you have, and starting from there; supposing that social principles can be elaborated independently of a determinate historical starting-point: these were conceptions of the Founding Fathers and, again, of the frontier situation, and it is not fanciful to see the willingness to start from historical scratch as an American disposition which, explicitly in Nozick but effectively in both these writers, conditions their works, and, indeed, lies behind the vigour with which a range of writers have been willing to tackle the questions of social principle which I mentioned earlier. In all of them, there is an approach from individual morality, combined with a readiness to school it to theory and to accept new consequences. An important contribution to this activity is undoubtedly made also by that respect for general theory which is now a very widespread and invigorating feature of American philosophy, as opposed to the piecemeal methods which were the ideal of British philosophy in the Fifties, and which did have, at that time, great influence in America.
While this work in political philosophy is often valuable and exciting, it does sit oddly to present discontents. It does seem rather late in the day to come so directly to politics from purely moral conceptions—though reasons for the vigour of this moral reaffirmation can themselves be found in recent American history. It is hard, again, to accept a political philosophy which does not start rather more determinately from the highly elaborated, and very densely occupied, social and political scene we actually have. Where the frontier was is now Cleveland or St Louis, and a situation in which we could really make a new start would be one in which alarmingly little would have to be left. People who were in that situation might not find themselves with just those moral responses on which these philosophers, in their different ways, markedly rely.
I have concentrated on American developments, and, in particular, on the work of Rawls and Nozick, because these seem at present to be the most strikingly original and influential developments in a field which shows signs of continuing to develop more broadly. Two kinds of development beyond the limits of their work are, I think, to be hoped for. One is that there should be work which is more closely based on the current historical situation and, correspondingly, grounded in a closer relation to the social sciences. Another possible development, a desirable one, is that the methods and standards of analytical philosophy should come closer to those concerns which have animated neo-Marxist and neo-Hegelian critics of our society, concerns which have, so far, been expressed in more archaic philosophical forms. Both possible developments have a requirement in common: that historical understanding should be brought into the picture in a way in which it conspicuously fails to be in the work that I have been discussing.
The Life of Bertrand Russell, by Ronald W. Clark; The Tamarisk Tree: My Quest for Liberty and Love, by Dora Russell; My Father Bertrand Russell, by Katharine Tait; Bertrand Russell, by A. J. Ayer
Bertrand Russell’s Autobiography (which was published in three volumes in the 1960s) is a work that leaves one in more than one way winded. It is not altogether a book, bringing together a rather random collection of letters with a sketchy account of the author’s life which, though sometimes alarmingly frank, omits much and hurries the reader on from one cursorily described event to another. It is not just the speed of travel that leaves one gasping, but the glancing view of some episodes that Russell puts in. One is several times confronted with a summary or dismissive account of central, professedly transforming, occurrences in his life, which cannot, surely, represent things as they were then lived, yet at the same time is not just the misleading product of a distant or oblique style of recollection.
There is no recognizable economy of narration which explains the effect produced by the Autobiography. The spiritual transitions which flash by, which are enacted between the striking of a match and the puffing of that ubiquitous pipe, do not seem as blank and unreal as they do because the structural outlines are left on the horizon, the emotional materials having burned or wasted away. On the contrary, it is the language of intense and overwhelming feeling, for a person or for the sufferings of mankind, that itself lights up these Polaroid snaps of Russell’s past and leaves the reader with a problem about how Russell could possibly have understood himself, either when he wrote these pages or when what he wrote about occurred. The most famous, now notorious, case is his account of his deciding on a bicycle ride that he no longer loved his first wife, Alys, and pedaling back to live for years in accordance with that discovery. But there are many other passages in which references to extreme or drastic resolution leave the reader bewilderingly distant from any conception of Russell’s self-understanding.
Mr. Clark’s long biography does much to help us on questions of fact, to fill in holes in the story, and to correct some impressions left by Russell’s account.1 For one thing, his affair with Connie Malleson (“Colette”) went on longer, and had more echoes in Russell’s later life, than you would judge from the Autobiography. Clark has taken great pains with an enormous amount of material, Russell’s widow having given him full access to documents. He makes a number of new discoveries and suggestions, very plausibly proposing in particular that the object of a passion in Russell’s earlier life, whose identity he concealed, was in fact Mrs. Alfred North Whitehead. He is good, also, at sorting out more recent events, and gives a very reasonable account of Russell’s involvement in the Committee of 100 against nuclear weapons, and his eventual quarrel with Ralph Schoenman.
The amount of work that has gone into producing this well-documented and clearly signposted account of Russell’s life is not to be underestimated. But one cannot pretend that it is an illuminating or even a deeply enjoyable read. It has the property of large books sold at airports: the author judges that he has his reader for a long while if he neither lets him sleep nor makes him work, so that the style is by turns undemandingly bland and stridently chummy. “Bertie … was therefore denied the tempering ordeal of a public school and consigned to a mixed bag of governesses and tutors,” he cheerily says near the beginning, and the tone is not untypical. Several reviewers have remarked that the style seems to get less embarrassing as the book goes on, and this is true, but it is hard to know whether the reason is that Clark is more used to his subject, we are more used to Clark, or Clark finds the events of Russell’s later life easier to deal with.
One reason might be that Russell’s contributions to philosophy in his later life were less fundamental, both to the subject and to Russell’s view of himself. Clark’s occasional dealings with Russell’s philosophy are unsuccessful, and indeed it is not easy to guess what he takes himself to be doing. Many of his brief accounts of Russell’s philosophical work can be read in more than one way, and one of those ways is usually not totally wrong; but it seems rash to suppose that that will be the one to occur to a reader who benefits from being told, as Clark tells him, that Leibniz was “Voltaire’s Dr. Pangloss, the German polymath who had waltzed through the second half of the seventeenth century as philosopher, scientist, mathematician and diplomat.” A basic weakness of such accounts is that they do not rest on knowledge of other philosophy; one reason why Clark makes a mess of the admittedly hard task of explaining what Russell’s most famous logical article, “On Denoting,” is about is that he is not familiar with Frege’s treatment of the issues, from which Russell started. Clark falls back on identifying the main point of the article with its most prominent joke.
It is a pity that Clark has not got a better sense of Russell’s major work; for one thing, it means that Russell’s relations to others who affected him in that work, above all Wittgenstein, are very vaguely characterized—these geniuses engaged in deep and difficult subjects are presented as grand and quaint, like great physicists in a TV documentary. But Russell’s major contributions were to very technical and abstract branches of philosophy and logic, and it is unreasonable to hope that his biographer will be an expert in those subjects.
Even A. J. Ayer’s book, which gives a marvelously clear and of course utterly professional account of some of Russell’s central ideas in philosophy, does not take on the hard task that lies beyond the recognition that Russell made a great contribution to the philosophy of logic: the task, that is to say, of assessing exactly how much difference Russell’s work made to the development of modern work in the foundations of mathematics. Clark does best with Russell’s more popular writings on ethical and social subjects—a department in which Ayer, for his part, mostly contents himself with a brief account of Russell’s not very interesting theoretical opinions in moral philosophy, accompanied by some bleak tutorial comment on them.2
What is more unsettling than Clark’s dealings with Russell’s central philosophical work is his uncertainty of taste in assessing Russell’s rhetoric. A Free Man’s Worship is described as “a short but profoundly moving cry of defiance against the human predicament, couched in terms of romantic disillusion”; but it is not only a dated but also a hollow piece of oratory, and Clark’s acceptance of it at its face value shows a lack of curiosity. Russell himself was later, in his more Voltairean period, to have doubts about its style, but the weakness of its costless heroics against cosmic indifference went deeper and further than he recognized. There is an absurdity in Russell’s resentment at the universe’s failure to live up to man’s expectations, a resentment which seems an extension of his annoyance at mankind’s not living up to him. “I am ashamed to belong to such a species,” he wrote in 1916.
There is a fascinating page in volume two of the Autobiography dealing with that period, where, writing of making love to Connie Malleson during a Zeppelin raid, he describes sentiments about the war which he felt intensely at that moment, sentiments which show up as not totally free either of easy heroics or of contempt for the idiot mob. This love for humanity, coupled with a dismissive hatred of many of its deepest characteristics, is typical of Russell and is obscure enough to blur the picture of his love for a particular person, which he insists on bringing together with those general feelings. Of his relation to Connie Malleson, he said that it was “never trivial and never unworthy to be placed alongside of the great public emotions connected with the War.” But where exactly does that place it?
Often, Russell writes of feelings as though they were unmeasurably overwhelming, and yet as though, in the next minute, he had quite straightforwardly got their measure. This phenomenon, so bewildering in the Autobiography, turns up in several curious passages quoted by Clark. Writing to Ottoline Morrell, Russell speaks of what he called his “first conversion,” in the presence of a woman who Clark has given us reason to believe was Mrs. Whitehead:
I came to know suddenly (what it was not intended I should know) that a woman whom I liked greatly had a life of utter loneliness, filled with intense tragedy & pain of which she could never speak. I was not free to tell my sympathy, which was so intense as to change my life. I turned to all the ways there might be of alleviating her trouble without seeming to know it & so I went on in thought to loneliness in general, & how only love bridges the chasm—how force is the evil thing, & strife is the root of all evil & gentleness the only balm. I became infinitely gentle for a time. I turned against the S. African war & imperialism (I was an imperialist till then) & I found that I loved children & they loved me. I resolved to bring some good & some hope into her life. All this happened in about five minutes.
Certainly thoughts relating to each of those things could intensely pass in five minutes. Perhaps one could even end up after five minutes in those states (though the discovery about children seems a bit ambitious). But certainly no grown-up person should write in retrospect as though a five-minute sequence of intense emotion was itself the entire enactment of all those life-transforming changes; any more than one expects him to be able to write, in all solemnity, of a different time:
That was the only time when I completely lost faith in myself & thought of myself as a mere cumberer of the earth. I resolved to commit suicide as soon as I could get rid of certain definite obligations which for the moment made it impossible.
It was not just Russell’s feelings, but the fact that he had feelings, that excited him, and this certainly contributed to the now well-known emergencies of his sexual life. Clark gives some idea of the different significance to Russell of different relationships, though he tends to adopt a rather breezy and knowing tone about some of it, and he leaves us outside the complexities and strangenesses of Russell’s relations to Ottoline Morrell. Some of Russell’s reactions, particularly in self-justification, are certainly surprising—sometimes it is hard to gather even what he thought he was saying. When he had just had a brief affair in America with the unfortunate Helen Dudley (who later followed him at his suggestion to England, but proved boringly unequal to Russell’s feelings about the war), he wrote to Ottoline, with whom he was still intensely involved:
I do not want you to think that this will make the very smallest difference in my feeling towards you, beyond removing the irritation of unsatisfied instinct. I suppose it must give you some pain, but I hope not very much if I can make you believe it is all right & that she is not the usual type of American. The whole family are extraordinarily nice people….
But it must be said that he was able to extract strikingly long-lasting devotion from others: Alys, a pathetic figure in Clark’s representation, still in love with him, apparently, until her death; Colette (who seems to have been marvelous) sending him red roses on his ninety-seventh birthday. And the autobiography of Dora, his second wife, though it sturdily sets out to live up to the self-reliant promise of its subtitle, in fact is a tribute to the power that Russell’s presence had in forming her life.3 In her book there is an implied, as well as a stated, acknowledgment of the sense of life that he obviously could, while he was still interested, convey. After he and Dora split up and he left the school they had started together, there were unceasing squabbles and pieces of litigation. While Dora Russell tells something of this tale, it lacks any great force of recrimination or self-justification or anything else—she seems to have lost interest. The pages of this book which stand out as vivid are those about their time in China together just before their marriage, when Russell was exceptionally happy.
Russell has been called a skeptic, and there is indeed a biography of him by Alan Wood (Simon & Schuster, 1958) subtitled “The Passionate Sceptic.” Skepticism is concerned with the withholding of assent, the sustaining of a state of intellectual suspense; it is very hard to find any strain of real skepticism in Russell, as opposed to an occasional judicious tone of voice and an advocacy of the virtues of benevolent reasonableness. His opinions were often dogmatic, simple, emphatically expressed, and poorly supported by evidence. They were said to be skeptical merely because they were antireligious and unpopular; perhaps also he seemed a skeptic because he appeared to want to believe some of the things he denied, and made it seem such a heroic feat not to deny that the world is as it is.
In his technical philosophy he was not a skeptic but, after his first years, an empiricist, and the main guiding thread to his development is his attachment to empiricist principles and habits of thought. As in the empiricist tradition, his philosophy of language is always closely allied to the theory of knowledge. It is impossible to give an account of his logico-linguistic treatment of particular terms and definite descriptions that does not also involve his conception of knowledge by acquaintance, of what can be grasped with certainty. A. J. Ayer gives a very clear account of how this works, but (no doubt because his own sympathies lie close to Russell’s) he does not bring it into such strong relief, or contrast it with contemporary alternatives, as D. F. Pears does in his book Bertrand Russell and the British Tradition in Philosophy (Random House, 1967). Related to that empiricist strain, but sometimes conflicting with its more radical demands, was Russell’s attempt to make his philosophy cohere with what he conceived to be the general findings of the natural sciences—something which brought him back to a causal theory of perception from the more Humean type of position which he occupied in the Analysis of Mind.
This element of respect for the sciences in Russell’s work might well prove more sympathetic to philosophers now than it has in the past twenty-five years, when Wittgensteinian attitudes represented any tendency of philosophy to be shaped by the natural sciences—and still more any attempt by philosophy to emulate them in method—as a basic indecency. A revaluation of Russell’s theories of knowledge and their associated metaphysics will need a less squeamish temper. It will also need a certain relaxation of the insistence, particularly inherited from G. E. Moore, on the virtues of literal accuracy, which Russell, always a swift and careless writer, treated with some disdain.
The time has come for that revaluation, and there is room for doubt about what will emerge: whether Russell has been seriously undervalued in these areas (as opposed to the philosophy of logic, where his reputation is assured), or whether it is true, as many philosophers would say, that the larger bulk of Russell’s philosophy is unfruitfully archaic. Unlike Moore and, above all, Wittgenstein, Russell was largely free of real worries, so characteristic of twentieth-century thought, about what philosophy is or could be. I think he regarded freedom from these reflexive worries as a mark of vitality, but it may prove to have been a kind of obstinacy which, together with his facility, led him to run up philosophical theories of just the kind that no longer have anything to offer. If Russell’s epistemological work does prove, on the other hand, to retain real interest, then it will have been a triumph, in a certain sense, of his naiveté as against the self-consciousness of his contemporaries.
In practical life, politics, and social opinion Russell was yet further removed from skepticism than in his formal philosophy. That moderation of assertion which is supposed to characterize the skeptic he used more as a rhetorical device than in a discipline of self-criticism, and the temptations of indignant emphasis often seduced him. Sometimes his published opinions were the victims of a haste imposed on him by the heavy journalistic routine which he sustained to keep himself and his family—Clark has a good quotation from a letter to Stanley Unwin:
It has been drawn to my attention that on page 209 of “Marriage and Morals” I say “It seems on the whole fair to regard negroes as on the average inferior to white men.” I wish in any future reprint to substitute for the words: “It seems on the whole fair,” the words “There is no sound reason.”
For a man who often insisted that practice should be guided by thought, and thought controlled by evidence, his enthusiasm for acting, and advocating action, on the basis of some flimsy bright idea was remarkable. It lay behind his advocacy of a preventive war against the USSR in the late 1940s, an episode particularly carefully investigated by Clark.
In a way that was, in its effects on other people, more painful, an amazing confidence of this kind seems to have attended the experiment of a progressive school at Beacon Hill which he and Dora undertook. Their daughter Katharine was one of the pupils, and her touching and unpretentious book gives a very real if avowedly subjective view of what it was like.4 Though he could also be great fun, theory in the form of some dire amalgam of Rousseau, Pavlov, and the Puritan conscience seems to have filled the judicious philosopher with an alarming degree of conviction, both in the general conduct of the school (which not altogether surprisingly came to bore him), and in his dealings with his own children. Mrs. Tait tells of a small, but to me chilling, episode when her brother John as a small boy had to stagger on a long climb from the beach with a rock which he wanted to keep and which was too heavy for him, having been told on clear and reasonable grounds of principle that he could keep it if and only if he carried it home by himself.
Whether it was enthusiasm for a new libertarian yet disciplined world, or political indignation, or sexual passion, or pantheistic surges, there emerges the impression that Russell was so relieved that he had powerful feelings that he was only too happy to take them at their face value. His theoretical philosophy, moreover, offered not much value to such feelings beyond their face. He made a harsh disjunction of reason and feeling, and held a simply deductive or instrumental view of reason. Such views offered him little space in which to understand feeling critically, or to deepen or enrich it. “He was especially prone to accept Hume’s theory that the emotions are detached, because he himself exemplified it,” as David Pears has said in his admirable review of Clark (The New Review, London, December 1975). If feelings did not mean what, at the reviving moment of their onrush, they seemed to mean, then perhaps they meant nothing at all; and if they meant nothing, then nothing meant anything. In this inability to detach the significance of feeling from its immediate aspect, there is something adolescent. D. H. Lawrence, who said a lot of silly things about Russell, and in some ways got the worst, from Russell’s well-known memoir, of their inevitable quarrel, nevertheless was centrally and deadly right when he wrote to Ottoline Morrell of Russell, then aged forty-three:
he is vitally, emotionally, much too inexperienced in personal contact and conflict, for a man of his age and calibre. It isn’t that life has been too much for him, but too little. Tell him he is not to write lachrymose letters to me of disillusion and disappointment and age; that sounds like nineteen.
This lack of a real relation to his feelings, his attachment to their surface meaning, shakes confidence in Russell. We cannot take him as a touchstone of things, and when he is presented, as he occasionally was by himself and more frequently by others, as the channel of reason or humanity or human dignity, there is reason for distrust. It is not as a selfless embodiment of rational principle that he is to be seen, nor is he one of those figures who divine, transmit, and shape feelings which are shared by others but elude those others’ formulation. Even in his stand against nuclear warfare, though it was important and impressive and admirable that he stood where he did and extended an emblem of reason against what is offered as rationality by technocrats and politicians, he did not gain his dignity in this by having any deeper understanding of things than they, or a more insightful conception of reason. He just obstinately, and valuably, placed himself where he did because that is how he then felt.
Even in this case, and still more obviously elsewhere in his life, it is not moral penetration that gives Russell’s life its extraordinary quality, nor is it understanding, whether of himself or of anyone else. It is his will, in the purest sense of willfulness. His embodiment of the aristocratic characteristics he was aware of in his conception of human excellence—“fearlessness, independence of judgment, emancipation from the herd, leisurely culture”; the sheer arbitrariness of his choice, on a considerable scale, to do what he wanted—these, together with his philosophical achievements, actually carry greater authority than his reasons for the social ideals he was always preaching, or the powerful cosmic and personal passions which so impressed him.

Reflections on Language, by Noam Chomsky; On Noam Chomsky: Critical Essays, edited by Gilbert Harman
Since the publication of Syntactic Structures nineteen years ago the general shape of Chomsky’s position in linguistic theory has become familiar. The subject, as he conceives it, is a branch of cognitive psychology; its basic problem is posed by the human capacity to acquire a natural language, something which Chomsky has insisted we should see as remarkable, with regard both to what the child experiences and to what he acquires. What he acquires is an indefinitely extensive creative capacity to produce and to understand an open-ended set of sentences that he has never heard before. What he is offered by his elders (or rather from them, since Chomsky thinks little importance can be attached to directed language teaching) is evidence, as he has put it, “not only meager in scope, but degenerate in quality.” The actual performances the child is exposed to are fragmented and distorted relative to his recognition, apparent in the competence he acquires, of what would be an acceptable sentence of his language.
To explain the gross disproportion between what is acquired (in the form of competence) and what is experienced (in the form of speech) we need to posit a strongly constrained, internal, innate mechanism which, when triggered by the experience of speech, builds a cognitive structure, a grammar of the language, within limits set by very specialized schemata. Any human child, moreover, can learn naturally any human language, so the schemata must be universal, and when Chomsky refers to the properties of the innate mechanism, he often indicates that each of us possesses, indeed knows, the principles of a universal grammar. His model, though cognitive, is also biological, and in the present book, which consists of three lectures given in 1975, together with a long paper which is a revision of one submitted for a Festschrift, he particularly favors an embryological analogy, in which development of language is compared to the genetically controlled development of an animal.1
As Chomsky has tirelessly pointed out to his critics, the mere idea of an innate component in learning a language is undisputed and uninteresting: the blankest theory of behaviorism requires some innate mechanism, however minimal. The important question concerns how complex and how specific to language acquisition the mechanism is supposed to be. In particular, Chomsky has differed from the empiricist tradition in regarding the mechanism as not simply one that applies a general learning strategy to language. Discussion over the past years, however, has made it clear that this particular difference between Chomsky and the empiricists is ambiguous, and some recognition of the ambiguity can be traced in the present book.
A “general learning capacity” might be defined in terms of some very simple learning theory, such as the traditional empiricist theories of “association” or of “inductive” generalization. In this sense, Chomsky convincingly insists that no one has offered a plausible or even coherent way of representing the learning of language by such empiricist learning theories. But it might also be true that very little that is learned can be represented in these simple empiricist terms: maybe most learning requires innate mechanisms more complex, and with more defined limits, than empiricism traditionally has allowed. If this is so, then the important question for language concerns how specific the capacity for language acquisition is, not the extent to which it is, peculiarly, innate.
The general issue is to some degree, but only to some, independent of what exactly the principles of the grammar of a human language have to be. Chomsky has retained, of course, his original picture of grammatical rules as being “generative.” They include transformational rules which turn abstract “deep structures” into “surface structures.” These surface structures take on a particular phonological form and emerge as the sentences one actually hears.
But many other more particular aspects of the theory have changed over the years. Above all on the matter of the relations between syntax (how and why a sentence is well formed or, in most everyday senses, “grammatical”) and semantics (what a sentence means, what it refers to, what has to obtain for it to be true), Chomsky has abandoned the “standard” theory of Aspects of the Theory of Syntax (1965), by which semantic interpretation was applied to deep structure. He now applies semantic interpretation to surface structure, a notable modification of his earlier views. On a verbal matter, Chomsky in these pages proposes giving up the well-known phrase “deep structure” for those initial abstract base sentences to which the transformations are applied. His grounds for doing so are revealing of what he cares most about. He argues that not only these base sentences, but processes applied at the level of surface structure as well, are “deep” in the only interesting sense—namely, expressive of important and hidden human powers.
On the questions of the relations of syntax and semantics, many other positions are possible and have been vigorously discussed. Some expressions of these disagreements about the place of semantics in transformational grammar are to be found in some of the papers collected in the book edited by Gilbert Harman;2 other papers take the discussion further, into questions about how semantics in general is to be understood and pursued—by using a theory of truth, for instance, as proposed by Donald Davidson, or by certain abstract structures of “possible worlds,” advocated here by David Lewis. It is exceptionally difficult for someone like myself, who is not engaged full-time in the technical literature of these subjects (difficult, also, I suspect, for those who are), to have any full sense of how these various approaches relate to one another and to generative grammar, or to understand how far these and other semantic theories exclude one another, or are rather dealing in complementary questions.
Harman’s collection, though it contains much good material, is not going to help anyone with this problem. His introduction is useful as far as it goes, but it does not go nearly far enough; and while the book is called On Noam Chomsky, in the case of one or two papers it would take someone with a sophisticated understanding of the subject to grasp why the matters discussed bear on issues raised by Chomsky at all.
Even when proposals about the nature of semantics are explicitly related to Chomsky, the size, weight, and exact location of disagreement can remain obscure. Harman valuably reprints John Searle’s admirable piece “Chomsky’s Revolution in Linguistics,” which appeared in this journal in 1972. In it Searle criticizes Chomsky for not associating semantic study with the notion of communicative intention; he urges his own and Grice’s theories of speech-acts, which link the meaning of the sentence to the intentions of the speaker, to fill what he sees as a void in the Chomskyan system—the point of language. Chomsky, in the present book, replies to Searle, but chiefly to deny, once more, the necessity of communicative intent, and to insist that uses of language can be thoroughly and seriously meant though not intended to influence any hearer.
As a graduate student, I spent two years writing a lengthy manuscript, assuming throughout that it would never be published or read by anyone. I meant everything I wrote, intending nothing as to what anyone would believe about my beliefs, in fact taking it for granted that there would be no audience.
But how could the existence of such cases possibly be the main issue? One would like to know whether, if what Searle says about the connections of meaning and intention were true, much or any of Chomsky’s views would be upset. It might be true that, despite exceptions, language is primarily or centrally connected with intentions to influence hearers’ attitudes; and yet some Chomskyan account of the capacities to produce and understand those utterances could also be true.
All through this field, as in other places where exciting work is going on, views which may well be compatible nevertheless struggle with one another. This is because they struggle for attention; the research programs may be compatible in content, but the thought that goes with each of them, “this is the way to go on,” excludes the others. This thought may be essential to the researcher—the synoptic peacemaker who pleads for compatibility is up in the observer’s balloon, not engaged at the scientific front. In Chomsky’s own case, however, a further dimension is involved, and a more important one. He associates his own approach with an affirmation of the depth of the human mind and the value of the individual, and he is suspicious on more than theoretical grounds of many styles of opposing theory.
Chomsky’s arguments with his opponents are painstakingly reasoned and academic in tone (though he is unduly given to that polemicists’ put-down, “unfortunately,” as in, “Unfortunately, X is rather careless in his references,” page 218). It is only after technical argument—but still too soon, granted some complexities we shall come to—that he falls back on ideological explanation, associating empiricist opposition to his views with social reaction. But through the laborious and sometimes peripheral self-defense, one can see that he is deeply distrustful and disapproving of some other ways of doing linguistics and the other human sciences, and that his linguistic theories, in their central contentions, have an ideological significance which relates them in some unclear but powerful way to his political and social outlook. This comes to the surface in a few pages of Chomsky’s present book, and it gets very brief consideration in the last item in Harman’s collection, Dell Hymes’s informative review of John Lyons’s book on Chomsky in the Modern Masters series (Viking, 1970). It is worth exploring further.
What exactly is involved in the innate component, what principles the language-acquisition device is armed with, are of course technical matters. But whatever they may exactly turn out to be, the more general question comes up of how to describe their presence. Chomsky has favored the terminology of unconscious, innate, knowledge, and this has helped to connect his theories with those Rationalist thinkers of the seventeenth century and later whom he has claimed, always with some caution, as his intellectual ancestors. Whether “knowledge” is the right concept, however, is a hard question. Certainly many objections which have been put to Chomsky, such as that, on his principles, a falling stone must know how to fall, entirely miss the point, and ignore the cognitive character of the states governed by Chomsky’s innate schemata, as Thomas Nagel well argues in Harman’s book. Yet, as Nagel also points out, there remains a long step to accepting the concept of knowledge as applying to the presence of the schemata themselves, and there are theoretical embarrassments in the use of that concept.
There is, for example, the question (raised elsewhere by Harman) of the vehicle by which this knowledge is represented in the mind, a vehicle looking suspiciously like another already mastered language. There is also the related problem that knowledge which is more than merely skill should imply the possession of concepts, and we have no reason to ascribe to the language-learner, at any level, the theoretical concepts of universal grammar. Chomsky’s own embryological analogy hardly points unwaveringly in the direction of a model that uses the notion of knowledge. In the present book he suggests that whether we call these potentialities “knowledge” is a verbal question, and he is prepared to let the word go; but how slight a concession this is becomes clear when he agrees to put, in place of “know,” the word “cognize.”
Chomsky’s insistence on a cognitive vocabulary to describe the presence of the innate schemata seems to be sustained by one of his strongest convictions, the power of linguistic theory to reveal the depth of the human mind. It implies an uncovering of lower, but continuously related, levels of human thought, and historically it helps to tie his theory to earlier Rationalist speculations. These, however, usually took a less naturalistic view of the mind than Chomsky does—the idea of a cognitive study as a branch of human biology is for Descartes’s own system unintelligible. But their views can, like his, be handily opposed to an empiricist outlook, which takes a shallower and more mechanical view of the psychological. That empiricist outlook can, moreover, Chomsky believes, be easily associated with a denial that there is a human nature, and with a manipulative and authoritarian conception of what can be done to human beings.
This opposition between rationalist and empiricist approaches (though, as Hymes says, Chomsky’s own theoretical work has transcended it) has great ideological significance for Chomsky. The empiricist conception of human beings as unpredisposed objects for conditioning he associates with potentialities for technological oppression. Chomsky admits that empiricist systems of ideas do, as a matter of historical fact, strongly resist being categorized in the way he requires, since the idea that there is no fixed human nature, but that man is a social product, has very often been associated (for instance, by many Marxists) with “progressive and even revolutionary social thinking,” while the opposite view has supported conservative and pessimistic outlooks.
“But a deeper look,” he goes on (page 132), “will show that the concept of the ‘empty organism,’ plastic and unstructured, apart from being false, also serves naturally as the support for the most reactionary social doctrines.” “Serves naturally” here is pure ideologists’ sticky tape, no better than “goes with.” Similarly unreliable connections are made when Chomsky goes into historical interpretation:
Empiricism rose to ascendancy in association with a doctrine of “possesive [sic] individualism” that was integral to early capitalism, in an age of empire, with the concomitant growth (one might almost say “creation”) of racist ideology. [Page 130]
In so far as this offers anything except evasive insinuation, it invites a quick answer: in any sense in which classical empiricism was “in association with” early capitalism, slavery, etc., so was its near contemporary, classical rationalism. No historical speculations of this sort can effect anything, and Chomsky’s other admissions show that he is, or at least has good reason to be, uneasy with them. He is likely to find better ground in certain features of the present. Now, when psychological technology is a conscious weapon of political power, and the notion of human needs as opposed to contingent preferences has been moved by many forces into the center of serious social thought, there really is a case for saying that the spirit of empiricist and, above all, behaviorist outlooks must, apart from their intellectual inadequacies, turn us in the wrong direction. Here Chomsky’s negative view, at least, seems to have real power.
But even so, it is more doubtful whether Chomsky’s own innatist doctrines can turn us in the right direction: they might even help to do the opposite. For here the question of the specificity of the language capacity, mentioned earlier, takes on a considerable and unexpected ideological significance. Chomsky’s claims have always been for the special character of man’s capacity for linguistic learning, and part of his evidence for this has precisely been that, the grossly defective apart, men are equal in this capacity, while differing in general intelligence and in their capacities to learn other things, such as physics. But now why should these distributions of innate capacities have any tendency at all to encourage belief in the foundations of libertarian socialism? Chomsky speaks of his hopes for progress toward human self-determination and genuine freedom; but the basic linguistic competence, as he describes it, has no connection with notions of progress at all—it is perfect as it is. What does leave room for progress, and indeed progress toward self-determination and freedom, is man’s lexical sophistication and conceptual grasp—but that, precisely, is a linguistic dimension in which men do differ, and in which the results of learning are not the same for all, and the innatist element correspondingly weaker.
Again, why should Chomsky’s theory have any power against racism, association with which was one of his more sinister charges against empiricism? In so far as racism has any coherent relation at all to opinions about different intellectual capacities, why should the fact of an equal innate capacity for language acquisition be thought to help against it? No theorist of apartheid is likely to be daunted by being reminded that the African child can effortlessly acquire Xhosa—or, come to that, Afrikaans.
If, on the other hand, the innatist claims are substantially extended from the field of language acquisition into other forms of learning (for instance, as Chomsky seems to speculate at one point, into moral capacities), the charge of their irrelevance to racist issues may decline, but the possibility of an unfortunate and destructive type of belief in their “relevance” might increase. It seems odd that anyone should need reminding at the moment that it is the environmentalist view on matters of “intelligence” which has been identified as the liberal one. The entire question of the ideological significance of such studies is now a notorious moral and intellectual mess, but to accept their ideological significance while cleaving to innatist styles of explanation may not necessarily be the most progressive way out of it.
An important point here is that in the field of language acquisition, Chomsky has good reason to equate what is genetically determined with what is common to the species. That equation may very well hold for all innate human cognitive capacities, but there is no a priori guarantee from the nature of genetics or anything else that it must be so.
The ideological implications of Chomsky’s theories are by no means straightforward or unambiguous, and Chomsky himself moves with dangerous speed and simplicity between his theoretical preoccupations and the political ideals for which he has so conspicuously stood up. In fact, the ideological effect of Chomsky’s work in language seems to me not so much to support or express distinctively socialist aspirations for society, or opposition to oppression, but rather, a stage further back, to assist a humane revaluation of tough-minded inquiry in the psychological sciences. His work, apart from its spectacular and ongoing effect in linguistics, constitutes the most powerful and encouraging reassurance that a psychological science which is recognizably continuous with the natural sciences does not have to treat human beings as very boring machines.
The recognition that human beings might be scientifically understood but are yet not just machines could well coexist with more than one kind of social or political view, not all equally liberal. But as well as being a vital truth in itself, it is a necessary step to any adequate views on these issues at all, including any adequate liberal views. It is here, in the humane understanding of science itself, rather than in more direct ideological interpretation, that the most general significance of Chomsky’s deeply impressive work is likely to be found.

The Selfish Gene, by Richard Dawkins
A philosopher, H.W.B. Joseph, who 50 years ago was (as Richard Dawkins now is) a fellow of New College Oxford, used to set as a first essay for philosophy students the problem: “what evolves?” Joseph’s question was a notably unfruitful one, but with the large and exciting development recently of both ideas and information in evolutionary biology, questions of that general sort retain their place in that they put a large premium on reflective power and intellectual imagination.
The sense that there are intellectual problems here which are both exciting and accessible, even if only imprecisely, to non-specialists, is well conveyed in Dawkins’s introduction to recent work in social biology.1 He discusses, with great clarity and an obvious flair for exposition, such subjects as the evolution of altruistic behaviour, and indeed of selfish behaviour; natural selection for sexual differentiation, the maintenance of sex ratios, and the evolution of the menopause; the importance of kinship, and its vital difference for genetic theory from mere group-membership. He throws light also on such things as deceit, mimicry and reciprocal altruism. He extensively and perspicuously uses decision-theoretical ideas, in particular Maynard Smith’s elegant concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy.
Dawkins is refreshingly free of two connected errors which rampage through popularisations of these subjects: that there is a straight extrapolation from the behaviour of systems under natural selection to anything at all about human society; and that nothing basic about human life is determined by culture. He explicitly and repeatedly denies both these falsehoods, and is very cautious in tracing any analogies between human social habits and genetically determined behaviour patterns in other species. He does, in a last and admittedly speculative chapter, try something different: not extending genetic theory itself into cultural phenomena, but applying to the explanation of cultural patterns a structure similar to that of genetic theory, using the notion of a cultural atom or “meme”, which is transmitted from one generation to another by education and socialisation. The bad experiences that the history of ideas has had with “atom-idea” concepts does not encourage one to believe in much future for this type of analysis.
The part of Dawkins’s account which will cause most trouble to the layman (I gather, to some experts as well) is the insistence, expressed in his title, that the unit whose “selfish” behaviour provides the motive power of evolution is the gene. Gene selection is the operative concept in evolutionary genetic explanation. Individual selection is, for quite a lot of the book, permitted, as an acceptable “approximation”. Group selection is throughout criticised and replaced by more basic modes of explanation.
This emphasis Dawkins presents in a good deal of rhetoric, some (like his dustjacket) of SF provenance. Animals and plants are “survival machines” which genes have built for themselves; a monkey is “a machine which preserves genes up trees”; “they swarm in huge colonies, safe inside gigantic lumbering robots … they created us, body and mind; and their preservation is the ultimate rationale for our existence”. He takes care to say that purposive language about genes is not to be taken seriously: it can all be translated out into statements about differential probabilities of survival and so forth. On this he does not mislead. But there are other objections. One is that the War of the Worlds image, apart from being (unlike the ideas themselves) rather boring, could leave an impression that even if genes do not really have purposes, evolution (after all) does, namely to make the world safe for genes—a purpose which is likely to seem obscurely threatening.
More seriously, the metaphors have not helped Dawkins to make entirely clear his answers to certain basic questions. In particular, I do not understand how exactly he sees the relation between three propositions which he asserts:
• that the genes which “struggle for survival” are pieces of chromosomal material;
• that a given piece does not always confer the same character—what it confers depends on context;
• that what are selected for, under evolutionary pressure, are characters.
In this connection, he does not give the reader the sense of seeing right into the question as much as he does with other issues in this successful and stimulating book.

The Fire and the Sun: Why Plato Banished the Artists, by Iris Murdoch
In this short book, based on her 1976 Romanes Lecture, Iris Murdoch takes up Plato’s celebrated attack, from the point of view of philosophy and truth, on art and the artists.1 She considers where its weight lies, and compares its inner workings with other distrustful placings of art against morality, notably Kant’s and Tolstoy’s. She offers some thoughts, lastly, on the theme of how we might take something like Plato’s point and yet defend art, resisting his demand that such art as may be allowed by the state to exist should be socially useful, morally celebratory, or at least decently minimal—and minimal would mean really modest: ‘the paintings of (for instance) Mondrian and Ben Nicholson,’ she excellently says, ‘which might be thought of as meeting his requirements, would I think be regarded by Plato as histrionic and dangerously sophisticated.’
The book is not just an aesthetic argument on Platonic themes. It aims to go a good deal into Plato’s philosophy, to such an extent that the publishers claim that it ‘comprises in an accessible form a general view of the development of Plato’s thought’. This emphasis is in more than one way a pity. It curtails to a fragmentary and tantalising brevity Miss Murdoch’s suggestive remarks on what she rightly claims is a real question: in what way serious art can be understood as anything but threatening by a view which puts a conception of human goodness—as distinguished from human achievement—at the centre of life. In the place of pursuing that question in its own, and our, terms, Miss Murdoch’s chosen plan gives much room to a very curious account of Plato’s philosophy.
It is, first of all, in no obvious sense ‘accessible’. It is allusive and offhand: for one thing, no one will find it at all easy to follow unless he already knows something of the order in which Plato’s dialogues are supposed to have been written. Barely intelligible references to one or two works of scholarship, not further documented, are scattered in parentheses. Remarks about different themes in Plato are put together in ways which are quite often imaginative but, equally, bewildering. She has not been helped, further, by the printer, one of whose many misprints issues on p. 3 in the misleading information that Plato’s Forms are ‘part of an argument for the immorality of the soul’.
If the account of Plato is hard to follow for those who do not know about Plato, it must be said that for those who do it is hard to credit. She relies on a resolutely simple account of the development of Plato’s thought about the Forms, of a kind which has been indisputably modified, and many would say quite discredited, by modern scholarship. It is central to her story, to take just one example, that the strange cosmogonical dialogue the Timaeus, to which she gives a lot of attention, be placed unequivocally at the end of Plato’s life; but for the past 25 years at least this date has been strongly disputed, and anyone who puts so much on the old dating owes the scholars an argument or two.
It is a pity that all this has to be said, since the interesting questions could emerge without any commitment on these issues. Plato in one period, Plato in one mood, or merely Plato as he has often seemed, would serve better to set out her central themes than the elaborate involvement in speculative history and creaky scholarship. Among the several ideas that curl about in the rather cramped space left for them, a main stem is this: for Plato, beauty is a conception which, properly grasped, is allied with truth, knowledge, and moral demands, against art, pleasure, and the indulgence of the ego. The image of the Forms, unchanging intellectual objects, stands as a picture of the moral world, of the world of goodness, which makes an unyielding demand on human beings who, considered merely in themselves, are, in a phrase of the old Plato which is quoted more than once, ‘nothing much’. Platonic Eros, the passion for pure beauty, aroused for him in the first instance by boys and perhaps also by nature, but not (unlike us) by art, reaches out to that order of things that lies beyond us. The hardness and necessity of that moral order is linked also with the necessity of the natural order. For us, this necessity is, no doubt, just the necessity of how things are; for Plato, it is the necessity of the Cosmos, of the world conceived as created by and expressing ‘passionate selfless unenvious mind’. (No disjunction of fact and value here, no mere equivocation on the ‘must’ of what we must do and of what must be.) Reality and goodness must after all be one—Plato’s central doctrine: not because what is tangibly real, here and now, must be good—quite the contrary; rather, because both truth and goodness stand opposed to fantasy, distortion, the imaginative indulgence of the ego.
Miss Murdoch moves Plato, in his moral aspects, as close as she can get him to Kant, so that the Forms seem like a Greek façade surrounding that Gothic image, the Categorical Imperative. I think that this is a mistake about Plato’s moral psychology, which is in fact more egoistic, and more illuminatingly so, than she makes out. As an issue of general principle, not of history, this is an important point: much can turn on whether we picture morality in terms of abandoning ego in favour of reason, reality, or duty, or see it rather in terms of the formation of an ego on which the claims of morality can constitute reasonable demands. The Greeks generally, and rightly, preferred the latter, though there is a line in Plato, the line which Miss Murdoch exaggerates, which leads indeed in the direction of the former.
Suppose we are seized, as well we may be, by that line, and rest the weight on a conception of the good as something external to the ‘greedy’ ego (as Miss Murdoch often calls it), something inherent in a hard order of reality. What will we or she say to the claim—a pressing one, after all—that there is no such order of things, that what she would have us yearn for is not there? This is an embarrassment which has been latent in other of Miss Murdoch’s writings, and not solely in her philosophy. Faced with the historical retreat from a conception of the moral order as transcendental, one who nevertheless insists that goodness lies in correct perception and freedom from error will inevitably tend to locate the subject-matter of that knowledge or error merely in the world around us: the misperception which is sin will have to consist in a misunderstanding not of the cosmic order of things, but (for instance) of other people. In that direction, in total and ironical contrast to the original spirit of the thing, lies cosiness. Only connect, understand others, you cannot will evil. It is a pity—though, granted much else of what he said, hardly a surprise—that Nietzsche has not yet succeeded in persuading us what a hopeless thought that is.
Miss Murdoch, retaining a schematically Platonic language at least, but with something of a modern blank where the Cosmic Thing used to be, defends art against Plato. But her defence, in the last pages of the book, is notably thin and, to tell the truth, distinctly easy-going by the standards earlier praised. One thing art does is to stand in for the life of the Platonic sage. ‘It is just as well that there is a high substitute for the spiritual and speculative life: that few get to the top morally or intellectually is no less than the truth.’ (I wonder where she puts the moral top.) ‘Art is a great international human language, it is for all.’ (Why? Are the qualifications for understanding art lower than for understanding people?) ‘Of course art has no formal “social role” and artists ought not to feel that they must “serve their society”. They will automatically serve it if they attend to truth and try to produce the best art (make the most beautiful things) of which they are capable.’ (Two gigantic questions are begged there. One—that to serve art is to serve society—is centrally raised by Plato himself; the other—the equation of good and beautiful art—is raised by most modern art, at least.) ‘The connection of truth with beauty means that art which succeeds in being for itself also succeeds in being for everybody.’ (What—now?)
These are sentences which, carefully considered, would not have been written. It is a bit unnerving that, consecutively, they should be among her concluding reflections. It also belies many good things in the book—she has excellent things to say, for instance, on the morally destructive powers of irony, and on religious imagery in art. But on what we can and should now think on the largest issues she has raised, she sinks from the high and icy Platonic challenge to a very undemanding level of comfort. It is a striking fact that her most eloquent writing in this book is in the cause of a world view which we and she must know is an illusion.

The Logic of Abortion
I want to take up some of the moral and philosophical issues involved in present controversies about legalised abortion. The puzzlement that people feel about this issue, and the deep disagreement that obtains between different people, are of the kind that invite philosophical reflection, and, in fact, a great deal has been written by philosophers about the issue in recent years, both here and in the USA. Though I shall not try to conceal my own views, what I shall try mainly to do is separate and point out some of the main threads in this discussion, rather than present a case.
A lot of the most important questions about the abortion issue I shall not try to discuss at all. Apart from some important practical issues, there are also some leading moral issues I shall have to leave aside. For instance, is it fair that women should find it easier to get an abortion in some districts rather than others? Again, how can we reconcile a woman’s right, under the law, to have an abortion with a doctor’s right not to perform an operation he morally disagrees with? These questions I shall have to leave aside. I shall consider only some of the most general questions raised by the principle of abortion.
One thing to be said about this debate right away is that it is, at no point, distinctively a debate about religion. It is, indeed, a fact that, among those who oppose the deliberate termination of pregnancy, many are Christians, and, in particular, Roman Catholics, but the views that they bring to bear on the issue are not uniquely Roman Catholic views. You do not have to have religious beliefs to be against murder, and it is not peculiar to Catholics to classify abortion as murder. Since the issues are not essentially connected with religious beliefs, I shall not make any special reference to religion from now on.
The shortest moral argument against abortion is the one I just mentioned—that abortion is, simply, murder. This very traditional line of argument will say: murder is the deliberate killing of an innocent human being; that is exactly what abortion is; it is therefore wrong. Let us call this the ‘murder argument’. It is a very simple argument. To those who offer it, that seems part of its virtue—it is a mark of its truth, which sophisticated qualifications are only designed to evade. To other eyes, its extreme simplicity seems to be bought just by assuming the answers to all the important questions before one begins to look at them.
Among those who want to crack the smooth surface of the murder argument, there are, of course, many different approaches. They can be usefully divided, I think, into two camps. The first camp shares a certain belief with the murder argument itself: that the central question here is a definitional question, in the sense that the important point lies in defining what class of beings the rule against deliberate killing applies to, and whether the foetus belongs to that class. This approach agrees with the murder argument in method, by treating the issue rather like a legal question about the application of a law, though it disagrees, of course, about what the verdict should be. The second camp of those who reject the murder argument want to get away from that type of debate altogether.
The main definitional issue has been whether the foetus is, within the terms of the moral law against murder, a human being or not. In one way, the answer to this question seems to be ‘yes’, and, indeed, obviously ‘yes’. The foetus is, after all, a living thing, and it does not belong to any other species. But then we are faced with the familiar fact that the foetus is, up to a certain point, not a formed human being, and, even after that point, it is not a fully formed human being. If one pursues that kind of consideration, one can naturally arrive at the conclusion that it is when the foetus is viable that it is properly or fully a human being; and drawing the line at this point will, of course, yield a more permissive abortion policy than the murder argument originally anticipated.
If the murder argument is going to insist absolutely on the humanity of the foetus before viability—its humanity, that is to say, in the sense relevant to how it is to be treated—then certainly it will yield a quite strikingly conservative abortion policy. If you consider a separate, already born, human being—consider, for instance, one who is already grown—it would be generally agreed that one cannot just kill him because he is likely to contract some disabling disease, or, again, because his mother runs a risk of death or injury if he is not killed; and since the point of the murder argument is to insist on the equal humanity of all human beings, it could not permit even very early termination, even in cases where deformity or disablement of the infant is indicated, or, again, serious harm to the mother.
The murder argument, then, in its use of the concept, ‘human being’, seems to yield either a very permissive abortion policy or an absolutely rigidly negative one: a permissive policy if ‘human being’ implies viability and a negative one if it does not. In this second, rigidly negative version, the argument is using one undoubted biological fact—that the foetus is a developing member of the species—to do all the work, while many will feel that their problem starts from that fact and cannot simply be solved by referring to it.
A different definitional question arises if one applies the prohibition on murder not to human beings as such, but to persons. Even if the foetus is a human being, it seems easy to deny that it is a person, where this implies faculties of communication, relations to others, consciousness of a fairly complex kind, and so on. Some philosophers argue that it is not human beings as such, merely biologically determined, that we should be particularly concerned with, but rather with persons; and the foetus is not yet a person.
The trouble about this—or, rather, what I find the trouble about this, since the philosophers in question seem to be pretty unconcerned about these consequences—is that, if the foetus is not yet a person, then neither is the newborn baby; nor again, if the requirements of personhood are made sophisticated enough, will small children be persons. What is more, the senile, and other adults in a defective condition, will be, on this sort of showing, ex-persons or sub-persons. Of course, those who think in this way will urge other rules with respect to non-persons, and will doubtless urge us not to cause unnecessary suffering to any sentient thing. But if failure to qualify in the person stakes is enough, as this argument would have it, to eliminate restrictions on killing the foetus, it is presumably enough to remove restrictions on killing those other non-persons as well, and the results of taking this line will be wide-ranging indeed.
There is a deep fault with the notion of a person, as used in these connections. It sounds like an all-or-nothing matter, whether a given creature is a person or not, but, in fact, the term turns out just to mean that the creature displays, to some extent—it seems, an arbitrary extent—some psychological and social characteristics which lie on a sliding scale. Unlike the matter of degree presented by the physical development of the foetus, questions raised by the variable scale of psychological characteristics arise all over the place: with the old, for instance, as I have mentioned.
The ‘person’ approach to abortion presents, perhaps more than any other, the danger of the slippery slope, by which one’s decisions about abortion leave one with no way of resisting other policies about killing and death about which one would have the gravest qualms. Some tough philosophers would say that this merely shows that we should not have qualms about those policies, such as infanticide, suppression of the senile, and so on. I find it quite unclear, however, what is supposed to give their arguments more authority with us than is possessed by our sense of humanity, as it is significantly called.
I have already touched, implicitly, on the notion of a right, and the language of ‘rights’ is indeed involved quite deeply in this debate. It is invoked, of course, by both sides. Thus, on the one hand, there is talk of the rights of the unborn child; on the other, one hears, sometimes, of the right of the woman to do what she likes with her own body. These particular ways of talking about rights very obviously presuppose, each in its own way, answers to the definitional questions I have just been discussing. If you can dispose of the issue by saying that it is just an issue of the woman’s right to do what she likes with her own body, then you are implying that the foetus is to be regarded just as part of the woman’s body, which is to answer the definitional question one way. If you treat the matter in terms of the rights of the unborn child, then you are answering the definitional question the other way, seeing the foetus as a human being, like any other, with rights. So these particular ways of bringing in rights are very closely tied to the definitional issues.
Another line of argument, however, makes an effort to get away from the definitional issue, and belongs rather to what I called, earlier, the second camp of those who resist the murder argument: the camp of those who try to get away from the question of defining the foetus, whether as a human being or a person. They may say: ‘Let us agree, if you like, that the foetus is a human being, and killing the foetus is a case of killing a human being. The question is, in what circumstances one is justified in doing that.’
One way of trying to answer that question has, again, invoked the idea of a right. It asks whether we can think of circumstances analogous enough to the situation in which abortion is at issue, to help us decide whether we could have the right to kill a human being in such a situation. A bold argument on these lines has been advanced by the American philosopher Judith Jarvis Thomson. She suggests that, if one woke up one day and found oneself strapped to another adult human being, with his life-systems dependent on one’s own, so that the only way to get rid of him was to kill him, then one could have the right to kill him—even if one was partly responsible for his being there. I have presented the example very baldly, without Ms Thomson’s striking and chilling elaboration, which makes it more plausible than perhaps I have done, that one would have the right to kill this incubus.
But even if one were persuaded that one had the right to kill the incubus, it is hard to see how that conclusion could merely carry over to the abortion case. One difference between the cases is that pregnancy is normal and not freakish. Another is that, in itself, it only lasts nine months. Another is that, because it is normal, and normally issues in a baby, it has sentiments and reactions attached to it which could not be attached to the freakish case of the incubus. These differences do not all cut the same way with regard to the abortion issue, but, in my view, they do discourage the idea that we are going to get much insight into the rights and wrongs of abortion by considering what we might say about rights in such imaginary situations—situations which may have some structural resemblance to the pregnancy situation, but are, at the same time, freakishly unlike it.
This brings out a question which has been gradually pressing itself on us all the time: whether pregnancy, the situation in which abortion is in question, is enough like anything else at all for us to reach answers about it by analogy from other situations. While the definitional approach was faced with the problem that the foetus is neither just like nor just unlike an independently existing human being, argument by moral analogy faces the problem that pregnancy is, at once, highly familiar and also very unlike any other situation.
There is one school of thought which, at any rate, is better placed to acknowledge that fact than the others I have mentioned. This is the utilitarian approach, which considers the issue entirely in terms of consequences, the consequences being measured in terms of happiness and unhappiness. This approach does not need to get involved in the definitional issues; nor does it find it helpful to think in terms of rights.
That it does not have to worry about the issues of definition comes out clearly when one reflects that, if we can think about social questions in terms of consequences at all adequately, we must, in general, be able to think in terms of the consequences of various policies for merely possible people, people who may not exist at all. In thinking about birth control and population policies, for instance, we have to think about how things would be for people who, if those policies are adopted, will never be conceived. All the more, then, we should be able to think about the possible welfare of someone who, if a pregnancy is terminated, will never be born, and it does not matter for this consequentialist argument how the foetus itself is classified.
Those who feel strongly that the foetus is an actual human being, with actual rights, will, of course, reject the utilitarian approach, which attaches little weight to whether this is an actual human being, and, in general, is not very concerned with rights. Utilitarians tend to regard the language of rights as an obscure and unhelpful way of discussing matters better considered in the light of the all-round consequences.
If we reject the view that the foetus is unqualifiedly a human being who has rights like any other—and I suggested, earlier, that the consequences of accepting that could be very conservative indeed—we will, to that extent, agree with the utilitarians about the abortion issue (though we may well not agree with them more generally in their unconcern for rights). But even those who agree thus far with the utilitarians may well have other worries about the utilitarian approach. Does utilitarianism pursue its study of consequences far enough?
Obviously, in a matter such as abortion, we must be concerned not just with the consequences of each particular case, for the particular mother and the particular child, if it is born. The more general consequences of having certain sorts of laws and practices also come into it. Here, it is a valid question to ask what sort of society the practice of abortion on a wide and liberal basis would fit into; what general outlooks would naturally go with it; what attitudes to birth and to killing you would have to teach young people if they were to live easily in such a society. Moreover, in asking that sort of question, we need to look to a wider range of values than utilitarianism admits—values which go beyond happiness, or, at any rate, involve a deeper conception of happiness than utilitarianism usually admits.
The situation we actually have now, it seems to me, is that this wide range of questions is most characteristically raised by opponents of freer abortion, who answer it by predicting a society indifferent to human life and to human values if abortion is widely sanctioned. Those on the other side often seem indifferent to the issues of how a certain practice demands an appropriate outlook and set of values to go with it, and what that outlook might, in the case of abortion, be. They urge the particular miseries of the particular cases, which is forceful enough, but this, often conjoined with an emphasis on individual freedom, does not meet the anxieties of the other side. Thus, each of these opponents feels that the other side is indifferent to what should most be cared about. This leads to something characteristic of this controversy: that each side honestly regards the other as heartless.
Clearly, the larger question must be raised. What sort of society would it be that had got thoroughly used to the institution of relatively liberal abortion? What kind of life goes with that? Would it threaten other values, such as the rights of the senile not to be tidied away? The question must be raised, but I do not see why the answer to it has to be hostile to a liberal abortion policy. I pointed earlier, to the fact that the pregnancy situation, the situation which raises the question of abortion, just is markedly different from others, in particular from others that involve life and death. This is not a problem which has to invite the slippery slope—even though it easily can do so if it is wrongly treated. A social context in which liberal abortion laws are both in effect and easily accepted may not have to be one in which there is general indifference to human life.
Whether it is actually possible, in the long run, to have a society which combines full acceptance of liberal abortion institutions with humane attitudes to such things as birth, death and killing depends, in part, on whether it is genuinely possible for most people, without either self-deception or brutality, to feel that the killing of a foetus is something basically different from the killing of a separate human being: to feel that, not just to think it. Whether that is possible for most people I do not claim to know. But there is one significant piece of evidence on the subject which does not seem to be often mentioned: that there is a difference between the death of a foetus in early pregnancy, and the death of a separate human being.
This is a difference, above all, in the experience of women. A genuine psychological distinction, for most women, exists with regard to spontaneous abortion: for most women, to miscarry at two or three months is not at all the same experience as a stillbirth, or an infant dying in its first weeks. I speak of the emotional or psychological difference, not just of the obvious physical difference, though that itself no doubt contributes. If there is that difference with regard to spontaneous abortion, it is no good, on the question of induced abortion, advancing theories or fears which involve the consequence that the difference should not exist, that miscarriage and stillbirth should seem the same. Yet many moral theories about abortion do seem to have that consequence.
This is a point about the experience of women. In the end, this issue can only come back to the experience of women. This is not because their experiences are the only thing that count. It is because their experiences are the only realistic and honest guide we have to what the unique phenomenon of abortion genuinely is, as opposed to what moralists, philosophers and legislators say it is. It follows that their experience is the only realistic guide to what the deepest consequences will be of our social attitudes to abortion.
On Thinking, by Gilbert Ryle
Gilbert Ryle, who died in 1976, was for many years a professor of philosophy in Oxford. He was a man of genially military appearance, with a knobbly, cubic head; rather soldierly in speech and manner, he punctuated his sentences with an abrupt half-cough, highly characteristic of him and much imitated. He was an exceptionally nice man, friendly, generous, uncondescending, unpretentious, and, for a well-known professional philosopher, startlingly free from vanity. He affected an amiable Philistinism, which to some degree was also genuine: ‘no ear for tunes,’ he was disposed to say, if music was mentioned. He was often amusing. He once said of a philosophically-disposed senior Tory politician that he stood like a light out to sea, firmly beckoning ships on to the rocks.
He gave very sensible advice, telling his pupils, for instance, not to do a PhD unless they had to, since it was ‘better to write a short good book later than a bad long book earlier’. He also gave excellent advice in philosophy, and communicated some good philosophical habits. His example was borne along on a certain anti-theoretical breeziness, but he showed philosophy to be a serious subject, and he conveyed a sound contempt for ‘isms’, schools, and mechanical party loyalties. He told a story, which he claimed to be true—and he was a truthful man—to the effect that when he had lectured in Germany after the war, a young man came up and said: ‘Doctor Ryle, I admired your lecture, and should like to join your school: unfortunately I am a Kantian.’
I first encountered Ryle myself as a student, around the time that he published his major book The Concept of Mind in 1950. The book had considerable influence, creating both a style and a focus of discussion. It was a professedly anti-Cartesian tract, aimed at ‘the ghost in the machine’, and against theories which represented the mental life as a hidden immaterial process duplicating or paralleling observable doings (as Ryle was disposed to put it). In pushing against such models, it inclined, to put it mildly, in a behaviourist direction. It seemed to suggest that there was no conscious inner life at all. This impression was not intended by Ryle, and was denied by him, but it was encouraged both by the general style of the argument and by the briskly commonsensical tone in which the mental life was treated. Along with the philosophical aim of reducing, so far as possible, the hidden inner to the obvious outer, Ryle seemed to have a more general project of replacing the less workaday with the more workaday.
Ryle had started out, in the late 1920s, with an interest in Phenomenology. He even wrote a quite favourable review of Heidegger’s Sein und Zeit when it first appeared. There are historical connections between these interests and some features of The Concept of Mind, but by the time he wrote that book his methods had become ‘linguistic’, and his style one of those that constituted what has been called ‘linguistic philosophy’. He dealt in uses of words, and his arguments rested heavily on considerations of what did and did not make sense. Since he wrote in English, it was a question of what did and did not make sense in English, but he always dissociated himself from the minute interest in fine points of usage which some of his colleagues displayed. He claimed that any sound argument of the kind that he used reached below the level of a particular natural language, and could be translated. The Concept of Mind has indeed experienced, and perhaps survived, translation into other languages, most recently—very recently—into French.
The idea that the results transcended any local language was expressed in The Concept of Mind in terms of a notion of categories, which allowed Ryle to say that certain terms stood for dispositions, or processes, or occurrences, and so forth; and he thought that the errors underlying the dualistic view of mind stemmed in good part from what he called ‘category mistakes’—in particular, from a tendency to interpret as a hidden or inner occurrence something that was correctly understood as an overt or behavioural disposition. Many of Ryle’s results took the form of allocations of concepts to categories, a style of conclusion memorably parodied by a student at the time in the dictum: ‘shop-lifting is not a feat of strength.’
In later years, Ryle became suspicious of the category machinery, feeling, as he was disposed to feel with any technical machinery, that it created its own problems. By the time he wrote the pieces collected in this volume, he had largely given it up. This book gathers together seven papers and one review all concerned with the topic of thinking, and also a fragment about another philosopher’s views of Wittgenstein. Three of the papers have not been published before; all the papers form part of the work Ryle had done for a book on thinking which he was planning when he died.1
The central question, variously and often obliquely approached, is one that he felt that he had left unsolved in The Concept of Mind: how to characterise that sort of thinking which consists in silent meditation or reflection, the activity, as Ryle constantly puts it, of Rodin’s Penseur. The Concept of Mind had effectively attacked any idea that mental activity typically takes such a form, or that intelligent action is action monitored by such an internal process. The book gave no account, however, of what that activity itself might be, and indeed left little room for its existence. In pursuit of this question, Ryle takes up such subjects as talking to oneself, teaching oneself, and thinking as soliloquy.
The apparatus of categories did earlier provide some rationale, if an obscure and insecure one, for the linguistic arguments. If one thinks that there is a basic, universal framework of categories, then it is a sensible procedure, by examining language, to try to relate various concepts to that framework. In the absence of that apparatus, however, Ryle’s linguistic arguments are scarcely tied to anything, and it is a persistent failing of these essays that it is quite unclear why given linguistic considerations are supposed to count for particular philosophical conclusions. Many of the arguments here fail, because they rest on no coherent conception of the relation between mental phenomena and the language that describes them.
Thus, supporting a conclusion of Zeno Vendler’s (a conclusion contrary to a long philosophical tradition) that knowledge is not a kind of belief—for example, true and well-founded belief—Ryle cites the fact that one can know what …, where …, whether … etc., but one cannot believe what … etc. But this does not prove anything at all. Leaving aside the important area of practical knowledge—and the tradition has not supposed that practical knowledge is a species of belief—the answer to Ryle’s point will simply be that if someone knows, for instance, who stole the jewels, then he knows of some person that that person stole the jewels: that is to say, he knows that something, and this knowledge may indeed be a species of belief. The grammars of ‘know’ and ‘believe’ are indeed different, but more than that is needed to lead one to this sort of conclusion about knowledge and belief.
Other arguments in the book are just too blunt and brisk. One of the more startling conclusions that Ryle claims is that it makes no sense to assert or deny that someone thinks in English, say, or French—or in words, come to that. If that is a truth, it is a surprising one. But the only argument Ryle offers, so far as I can see, is that an orator considering words for a speech, or a translator for a translation, does not think ‘in’ the words he is considering for his purpose, but thinks about them. No general conclusion can follow from that: he may think about those words in other words. There is probably a truth lurking in what Ryle says, but his considerations do not bring it to light.
Ryle believed in arguments in philosophy. The tiny fragment about Wittgenstein interestingly, and convincingly, makes out that Wittgenstein also did so, though it has been said that in his later work he did not (Wittgenstein seems sometimes to say it himself). Ryle shared also with Wittgenstein, and no doubt in part derived from him, certain other things. One was the important belief that the philosophy of mind had to get beyond both dualism and behaviourism: in these essays Ryle can be seen explicitly trying to do that, as he had not successfully done in The Concept of Mind.
Another thing he shared was a hatred, not of argument, but of philosophical theory. This distrust of theory was typical of much linguistic philosophy of the 1950s; with it there went a rejection of the idea that philosophy could be continuous with theoretical interests of the sciences. Ryle was open to many new philosophical ideas, but these limiting conceptions he sustained into a later time. When he found a disposition to theorise joined to an admiration for Cartesian notions of innate knowledge, every hackle was raised, and the only intemperate piece here is that in which, disagreeing now with Vendler, he attacks Chomsky for his well-known view that a child’s acquisition of language can be explained only by postulating a determinate innate mechanism for acquiring it, a mechanism which, Chomsky thinks, it is appropriate to call innate knowledge. It is a deep idea, and a powerful and illuminating debate has occurred about it. It is sad to find Ryle bluffly dismissing the whole business with a philistine diagnosis, clearly wrong, of why Chomsky thought that there was anything in it.
Ryle had a very distinctive style, marked by long lists of words, particularly adverbs, and by an epigrammatic turn. He seems to have developed the style without reflection, but he became very conscious of himself as a stylist, and the mannerisms eventually took over, and carried him at times beyond the bounds of self-parody. The most exaggerated example here is probably the first piece, in which he writes, for instance:
If Le Penseur is trying to compose a melody, then he is very likely to be humming notes and sequences of notes, aloud, under his breath or in his head—not just humming them, of course, but humming them experimentally, suspiciously, cancellingly, rehearsingly, recapitulatingly, and so on. These very notes and note sequences that he hums composingly, he might, by chance, have hummed gramophonically and with his mind on something else. Or if Le Penseur is trying to render an English poem into French, while he is unlikely to be humming notes and note-sequences, he is likely instead to be murmuring them, of course, experimentally, suspiciously, cancellingly, rehearsingly, recapitulatingly …
The mannerisms seem to have provided a substitute for the theoretical backing which he was so reluctant to give his arguments. He taught his pupils, in the most honourable and impressive way, to sift argument from rhetoric, but his own philosophy came increasingly to depend on an idiosyncratic rhetoric. Having given up the only account he had of the relations between linguistic observation and philosophical subject-matter, he was left only with common-sense and the resources of a style: a style which, to some extent, in its consciously dry jokes, expressed him, but which, under pressure of what it had to provide, was driven at the extreme to a kind of compulsive incantation which was far from the nature of this clipped, controlled man.
I knew Gilbert Ryle quite well, and liked him very much. As many others do, I owe him a lot, both personally and intellectually. I am afraid that those who did not know him, although they will get an overpowering sense of a certain style, will not find the real quality of his intellectual presence in these mannered, empty and unconvincing essays. They are late work, and he left better and perhaps more lasting material in pages of The Concept of Mind and in earlier papers. But it may be that, more generally, it was the activity rather than the product that mattered. I do not think that that would have surprised or upset him.

Rubbish Theory, by Michael Thompson
The author of this book was once a builder, working particularly for the ‘knockers through’, as he calls them, who turn two rooms into one in terrace houses and make other well-known changes to convert a collapsing slum into a thing of pride and a joy for ever. Thompson’s sharp descriptions of these operations, and of the contrasts between the attitudes of those who own these gentrified residences and their working-class neighbours, who regard few of their possessions as things of pride or joy, and certainly not for ever, offer some of the few enjoyable passages in the book. They also contain one of the main ideas for it.1
The idea is that what was originally regarded as a transient object—something which would last for a limited time, and then wear out—can make a transition into a durable object, regarded as lasting, theoretically, for ever; and that it makes this transition by passing through the category of rubbish, in which an object has no value at all. This category is at certain points said to be covert or invisible, which seems sometimes to mean that the category, or at least its operation in the system, is hidden from us, and sometimes (even less plausibly) that the objects in it are unnoticed. Slums are rubbish housing. Another example worked out to illustrate the idea is that of Stevengraphs, a kind of popular Victorian woven picture which sold for small sums in the 19th century and then disappeared from the market, until, by a familiar modern process, they were ‘discovered’, and now fetch large prices, have a written history, and so on. They are nearing the state in which they can fly out of the top of the exchange system altogether, and enter the ultimate reserve of durability—a museum.
The transition from transient to rubbish to durable is said to happen only in that direction. Nothing changes, for instance, from durable to rubbish, or gets from transience to durability without passing through rubbish. These results are protected against counter-examples largely by definition.
This structure, and the changes that occur within it, are then related to systems of social control. ‘Those people near the top have the power to make things durable and to make things transient, so they can ensure that their own objects are always durable and that those of others are always transient.’ Just as there was a doubt whether rubbish is invisible, or unthinkable, or both, it is not clear what it is, according to Thompson, that people near the top can determine: whether it is the actual pattern of ownership, or, rather, the way in which society thinks about the things that people happen to own. Having said that ‘slumminess is imposed by the social system,’ Thompson seems to be arguing with himself whether this means (or principally means) that the social system keeps itself going by creating what are indeed slums, or, alternatively, that ‘slum’ is a classification which the system allows the powerful to apply to whatever buildings it suits their interests to apply it to.
The theory next incorporates the notions of production and consumption. ‘Consumption’ is treated in a puzzling way; and certainly not as it is used in economics. Transient objects are ‘consumed’ when they are used up; rubbish is said to be ‘consumed’ when it is disposed of or processed, as in a sewage farm. Durables cannot be ‘consumed’. A certain amount of paradox flowing from the assumption that VAT is a tax on consumption—which, with ‘consumption’ used like this, it clearly is not—leads to reflections on art-objects, the resistance of artists to their works being treated as items of commerce, and so on. The structure of rubbish theory adds nothing to these ideas, and actually makes it harder for them to register their impact. The distinction between the transient and the durable is very poorly related to the distinction between what does and what does not have a market price, with the result that his vocabulary does not even help Thompson to make clearly a good point which, I think, he wants to make: that the attempted escape to auto-destructive or otherwise transient art-products will probably leave the artist still trapped within the commercial system.
At this stage of the book, rubbish theory, in its own name, steps back, and we turn to applications of catastrophe theory, a branch of mathematics developed by René Thom which provides descriptions of sudden and discontinuous changes. This is applied to a supposed cycle, suggested by Basil Bernstein, between a ‘collection curriculum’ in institutions of education, which consists of self-sufficient and separate subjects, and an ‘integrated curriculum’ which does not. The first of these is associated with authoritarian arrangements and Louis Dumont’s homo hierarchicus; the latter with democratic arrangements and homo aequalis. They are expressed, indeed, in different styles of architecture: ‘collection curriculum architecture emphasises the vertical; integrated curriculum architecture emphasises the horizontal.’ Even the undemanding reader who is nodding these assertions into his mind and out again may be held up by the next one: ‘the most complete and perfect example of the former is the Radcliffe Camera in Oxford: a Parthenon-in-the-round, presenting a perfect façade in all directions.’ The circle of the Radcliffe Camera, like the colour circle, one might have expected to serve rather well as an emblem of the opposite thing, curricular integration. I suspect that there must be something about its age or place that inhibits Thompson from working his trick the other way round.
Catastrophe theory provides a geometrical model for the sudden collapse of ‘boundary maintenance’ between subjects, so a collective curriculum under stress turns suddenly into an integrated curriculum—leaving, it seems, a mess, out of which people have to crawl back into a new collective curriculum. No evidence is mentioned that this cycle in curricula actually occurs, let alone that the particular set of psychological motivations invoked to explain it are relevant. We come out from Thompson’s wonder tunnel of three-dimensional graphs clutching no more than the recognition that if curricula developed, for any reason, in a cycle that involved sudden collapse, then catastrophe theory, the theory of sudden collapse, could be used to describe that cycle. Three minutes inside the Radcliffe Camera, or outside it, can give better rewards.
How the two main characters of this book, rubbish theory and catastrophe theory, are related to one another, is a question that is never discussed. The book ends with the modest claim that these theories will enable us to handle both persistence and change, both evolution and revolution, will substitute the ‘Heracleitean hypothesis’ for the ‘cartesian’, and, together, will ‘allow us to embrace a less repressive style in which problems give way to capabilities’.
There is, indeed, one substantial piece of theoretical work in the book: one chapter which offers what might be a contentful and interesting explanation of what is said to be a genuine social phenomenon. This is an explanation of a complex cyclical interchange of pigs and pork between tribes in New Guinea. However, this is done largely with some ideas from Keynesian economics: it uses catastrophe theory only in a marginal way, and it has nothing to do with rubbish theory at all. That section apart, this book contains virtually no serious intellectual work at all. There is no such thing as rubbish theory. There is just a bright perception, taken up from the surface of our culture, which might have made a jokey article. As a phenomenon, however, the book is striking: it combines in a very obvious and concentrated form all the most poisonous features of bad social science.
There is, first of all, a pervasive methodological mess: general statements which may or may not be tautologies; supposed paradoxes or ‘contradictions’ which are only the product of some unquestioned and idiotic assumption; vague assimilations of one thing to another, presented as theoretical discoveries of great abstractness and rigour. Mere rubbish, however, as Thompson himself insists, should not be saleable. What may give all this some popular appeal is something else: a pervasive knowingness, self-deprecating in tone, but suggesting at the same time a large and dangerous daring. Masks are being removed, threatening truths revealed, and a conspiracy of misdirection thwarted.
There is a particular trick which is used at several points to create this effect of risky revelation. It is one possible and appropriate aim of social science to provide a sociology of belief. From the starting-point that beliefs are to an important degree socially determined—something more widely recognised and more deeply discussed than Thompson seems to realize—he moves, usually in one sentence, to the suggestion that beliefs are politically determined, and serve some class or similar interest: with a flick of the wrist he manages to insinuate something hard-working Marxists are still struggling to define and establish.
The idea that beliefs are socially determined has well-known reflexive problems: what of the theory itself that reveals the determination? Much thought has been given to that question, from Hegel and Marx onwards. You would not gather that here. The witness to the problem, in Thompson’s text, is rather a characteristic tone: self-deprecatingly aware, at some points, of its environment, while vastly ambitious, at others, in transcending that environment; sometimes reflexively and tolerantly relativistic, elsewhere condescending, deflating and snide. It is the tone of much contemporary writing about society.
I have entertained the idea, and not utterly rejected it, that this book is a brilliant parody, a perceptive send-up of the most degraded kinds of social theorising. If so, it is too long, but marvellous. However, I fear that that is probably not so: if not, there must be some other explanation of how the book came to be so concentratedly what it is. It may have something to do with Thompson’s experiences as a renovating builder. Writing about those, he is noticeably uneasy, as well as condescending, towards his customers. He tends to fall back on the easy case where they can be despised for their taste, for putting in the wrong doors and fireplaces. But there must have been some, and he shows that there were, who made genuinely decent houses out of slums; at the same time, their relation to the neighbourhood, and to the social process in which they were all embedded, was much the same whatever their taste, and made him (and no doubt many of them) uneasy. He helped them to do these things, and was paid to do so; reflecting on the process, he was, very understandably, ambivalent about it.
Later, when he was lecturing in social science—probably, to infer from the book, to art students—he had new customers, keen to knock through the last distinctions in the decaying intellectual terrace. They must have multiplied his ambivalence in several dimensions at once. In this case, he was himself required to inhabit the terrace; moreover, he had no means of telling which was a load-bearing wall. His book is perhaps best heard as a cry, aggressive but still ambivalent, from under the rubble.

Lying: Moral Choice in Public and Private Life, by Sissela Bok
In 1960, when a U2 spy plane was shot down over Soviet territory, the Americans first denied that the plane had been spying; later, Eisenhower publicly owned up. The incident raised some questions about political lying. It was clear that what made the Russians particularly angry was not being spied on, nor being first lied to, both of which they took for granted, but being publicly told the truth, which put them in a difficult position. It was not clear, admittedly, exactly why it put them in a difficult position, since everyone—or at least everyone whose opinion in any way bore on them—knew that the first story was a lie; but clearly there is something to appearances (or was, since things may have changed a bit), even those that do not appear to be more than appearances.
Ms. Bok, though she refers to the incident more than once, does not take up such questions as what is saved in saving the appearances. Indeed, she mentions only the fact of the lie, and says that many Americans were shocked when they heard of it—and I take her to mean that they were shocked that it was committed, not that it was admitted. It is characteristic of her book that she leaves out the politically interesting half of the event. Her approach is that of moral philosophy: and what above all emerges from her treatment of lying is that she is against it.1
She has a good subject, and within the rather severe limits set by her commitment both to moral philosophy and to morality, handles it well. She gives useful materials on the history of the morality of truth-telling. She sets out clearly, and reasonably rejects, both the absolutist position which forbids all lying, and the consequentialist position which sees it as just one option among others. She considers, among many other aspects, excuses, white lies, lying to elicit the truth, and paternalism. She refuses to get bogged down in the excessive subtleties which have often been spun around the casuistry of this subject, whether it be about the exact difference between telling a lie and withholding the truth, or that between lying to someone and merely misleading them. She needs these distinctions, as the rest of us do, but she does not try to hang much moral weight on them. I take this to be a matter of moral as much as of philosophical principle with her: her severity falls as firmly on those who try to define their way out of lying as on those who go in for it. There are points at which she might usefully have been a little more philosophically insistent about the nature and boundaries of deceit. One small example comes up within the subject which is her usual field and which she discusses best, medical ethics. She is hard on the use of placebos, but she never exactly says why she supposes them to be deceitful. As the physician gives the starch pill he says (or his giving it says): “this will make you better”. If the patient believes him, and the doctor has chosen the treatment well, what he says is true. So how can he deceive? It cannot be that what his giving the pill says is “this will make you better whatever you believe about it”—many medicines would fail that test. It is, of course, easy to think of other things that the pill-giving might say, which would be false: as, “there is something in this which is specifically related chemically to what is wrong with you”. But why should we believe that the speech-acts of medical practice bear such precise pharmacological implications?
Ms. Bok’s doubts about the use of placebos probably relate rather to the fact that their use implies a lack of openness with the patient. There is something the doctor knows about the efficacy of this pill which it is essential that the patient should not know, and which cannot be declared between them. But Ms. Bok herself admits that there are some situations in medical practice of which that can properly be true; and if there are cures which work through belief, and which, when they work, validate that belief, then surely they would afford another such case?
The idea of openness plays a central role in Ms. Bok’s ethical thought. It is for her a vital test of the morality of a social practice, that the practice could be openly declared among all who are affected by it. A test of this kind has attracted a number of philosophers (it figures, for instance, in Rawls’ Theory of Justice), and it is certainly significant, but in the application to lying, at least, it is not at all clear how it is supposed to work. The test shares an important difficulty with one of its prominent intellectual ancestors, Kant’s Categorical Imperative, in that everything turns on how specific the rule is which is to be publicly understood. If there has to be a clear understanding between you and me that one may lie in the precise circumstances that we both know that we are in, lies are going to be less useful, at least, than they are at present. Indeed, it might turn out that they were no use at all. I suspect that Ms. Bok would subscribe to the maxim that one may lie only when one must lie, when there is no morally acceptable alternative. Granted this, it will follow that under conditions of sufficiently specific publicity, including your knowing that I am a conscientious moral person, my lies could not deceive you at all. At the other extreme to this, the conditions of the publicly acknowledged rule might be very unspecific, as that one may lie when the public interest is at stake: but then we are where we anyway are, in the ethical quagmire which Ms. Bok deplores.
There are, then, some theoretical doubts even about Ms. Bok’s moral test. But there are some deeper and larger subjects, which she never touches on at all. Some concern the relation of the values of personal honesty to other social values; there are also questions about the extent to which a moral test can, in public life, reasonably be expected to be observed anyway, and under what political conditions. The shadows of the Vietnam War and of Watergate fall heavily across this book, but virtually none of it, in fact, is about politics. There is a brief and rather weak final chapter in which some institutional aids to public veracity are discussed, but the book hardly ever confronts the issues of how truth-telling should be related more generally to politics and to social institutions.
To take just one issue, Ms. Bok unquestioningly assumes throughout that the demand for honest politicians, and the demand for limitless information—the “right to know”—support one another, and do not conflict. This assumption is open to question. One may have secrets whose content is not discreditable, and if one is allowed one’s secrets, one need not lie. Cases such as Watergate lead away from this issue. There, the secrets are indeed discreditable, and the lying simple villainy. From any moral point of view, in fact, Watergate is boring. No one doubts that those in power should not act like that. The interesting question—besides the issue of how such people come to power—is rather how one stops them so acting, and here the freedom of information must certainly help: the right to know is undoubtedly a weapon to discourage those in power from doing what they have no right to do.
The U2 incident, however, provides quite a different kind of case. If the right to spy is granted at all, then the right to know must be suspended; or if it is insisted upon, then its queries must be met with lies. Espionage, one must tautologously insist, is supposed to be covert. There are indeed questions, as that incident illustrated, about what sort of activity espionage is; what role it plays in national security; and what sorts of games, in the name of national security, are played between nations. But one thing that is clear is that so long as there are such activities, the more the right to know is insisted upon, the thicker the web of even domestic deceit must become.
A more trivial case, but with some similar lessons, is that of politicians’ private lives. Ms. Bok says that if politicians are subjected to improper inquiries about their private lives, they may withhold information, but should not lie. This is pious and unrealistic. It depends on the practices of the media, and on how the right to know is concretely interpreted, whether there even exists an option of merely withholding information. If the popular Press is at once insistent, slovenly, sensationalist, stupid and contemptuous, as in Great Britain, the well known may find that the only alternatives to lying about their private life may be those of having no reputation or having no private life.
This small area illustrates the general, and indeed obvious, point that the morality, and the necessity, of lying must always be a function of at least two other things: the nature, including the morality, of what is truly being done, and the kind of information that is being demanded, including the question of what it will mean by the time it reaches its destination. American politics has traditionally subscribed to the belief that the best way to secure right action and honest politicians is to make politicians and other public agents accountable under conditions of maximum popular investigation. At the same time, however, and as firmly, Americans have believed that their politicians are dishonest, and would be even more so if not pursued by the right to know. But the same ideas can be turned round to yield a different result: if there were less faith that politics could be an entirely open business, perhaps politicians would not need to be so dishonest.
It is not merely that Ms. Bok’s book suffers from an excessive confidence that the institutions which express the right to know can never conflict with the demand for public honesty. She tends also to overlook the role of institutions altogether, and to make the unpolitical assumption that what is principally needed to make political life better is more morality in it. There can be no doubt that it makes some difference what the moral character of politicians is. But beyond that, almost every question is open. There are questions of what institutions select for what kind of character, and of the extent to which the structures of power encourage politicians to exert moral pressure on each other. There are also questions about the variety of moral character that in given circumstances is most desirable. Ms. Bok more or less assumes, I think, that what is more desirable in rulers is a righteous character, and a scrupulous concern for principle. But I doubt that a Kantian Cabinet is really what we want; a certain honourable cynicism (though it is not all that we need) may serve better, for much of the time, to keep us out of the mud.
Ms. Bok should have been more impressed by Machiavelli’s question, whether, granted the world as it is, politicians can keep us out of the mud if they altogether refuse to get into it themselves. Rulers who do not have to do nasty things are not simply the cause of an acceptable social order—they are also something to be achieved by it.

Logic and Society and Ulysses and the Sirens, by Jon Elster
There are some pieces of logical or theoretical jargon which are marks of ideological allegiance—intellectual wind-socks to display which way the wind is blowing the author. While linguistic philosophers, at least of the older sort, ‘analyse’ some intellectual object, structuralists and their neighbours ‘deconstruct’ it. For Marxists, a set of interrelated problems is usually ‘problematic’; and what gives rise to their problematic, is involved in it, and needs to be overcome, is, standardly, ‘a contradiction’, where that is not something in their or someone else’s discourse, but an objective state of the world.
Logicians characteristically hate this use of the word ‘contradiction’, something which, they will insist, applies only to words or to thought: not, certainly, to the world. Even when the term is applied to actions or social states, items which at least embody or express thought, they will prefer to say something else, and speak of ‘conflict’, for instance, or practical impossibility.
The idea of contradiction which is not just an affliction of thought but is something real in the world, and which has to be overcome by progress or in thought or action, is due to Hegel, a fact which itself does not recommend it to the logicians. Great lengths of Hegel’s work indeed go under the title ‘Logic’, but little of it belongs to that science which was developed by Aristotle, the Scholastics, Frege, Russell and many hundreds of current practitioners who work in Schools of Philosophy, Linguistics, Mathematics or Economics. Among the many things that Hegel understood, logic in that sense—that is to say, the real sense—was not one. His unwieldy, slithering notions of contradiction and negation were included in his legacy to dialectical materialism, and some very dreadful and obfuscatory rot by Engels or Plekhanov, in which the corn negates the seed and so on, is owed directly or indirectly to him.
All that may be thrown away, and only the demands of religious observance could want it kept. But along with it, logicians and their natural philosophical allies characteristically throw out an entire dimension of social, political and psychological thought: a dimension which was among the many things Hegel understood, and which, indeed—so far as such a thing can ever be true of anyone—he invented: ‘Contradiction’ is a property of thought, and the attempts to apply it to the cornfield can be forgotten. But it does not follow from that that it is an affliction only of descriptive thought: it can apply also to social or individual projects or attitudes. It is not very helpful to extend it to any kind of conflict whatsoever. Conflicts of interest between peasants and workers do not in themselves constitute a contradiction: though some political project may involve genuinely a contradiction if it essentially involves having to satisfy both of two sets of interests which are essentially opposed to one another.
A policy, a social situation, a frame of mind, can involve contradiction in this way if it necessarily involves objective or other kinds of thought which are necessarily irreconcilable. Thus, in Hegel’s most famous and influential example, the master wants from the slave something he necessarily cannot have—‘unilateral recognition’, as Elster puts it in Logic and Society, a recognition freely accorded to him by someone who is a chattel, who cannot freely recognise anyone. This state of consciousness is essential to the master, and implicit in the historical forms that his institution takes.
There is nothing in all this inconsistent with real logic. In fact, however, the philosophers who live most intimately with real logic have not had much interest in these ideas, as Sartre’s existentialism did, or some forms of phenomenology, or, of course, Marxism. There are many reasons for this: most superficially, the dubious associations I have already mentioned of the profligate use of ‘contradiction’; more seriously, genuine difficulties, which indeed need investigation, as to the ways in which a particular thought form (a ‘consciousness’, as Hegel put it), or again a self-defeating project, can be necessarily involved in or presupposed by a social relationship or other historically-given development. Hegel had one big dark answer to that question; Marxists have lots of active answers, but they tend to scurry off when disturbed. That fact—together, of course, with the mere fact that the whole business has anything to do with Marxism at all—tends to keep the logicians away. A similar neglect is shown by the economic or social scientific theorists of rational behaviour. They are concerned with some kinds of logical difficulty which strategic thought can encounter: but their formal theories are characteristically too tied to simple conceptions of Utilitarian rationality, and their range of psychological and social reference is too narrow, for them to make much contact with this range of problem, grounded as it usually is in complex historical and psychological materials.
Jon Elster, in his brilliant, inventive, mercurial books of essays (as they both are, though only the second professes it), encourages these various parties to come and look at each other, and generates enough quick-fire excitement to make some of them surely want to do so.1 His versatility suits the needs of the case. He is a Norwegian, and, by affiliation, a Professor of History. He is a totally idiomatic writer, further, in both English and French and perhaps other languages as well. He obviously knows a lot of mathematical logic, economics, political science and formal decision theory. He quotes in an unforced and relevant way from Donne, Stendhal, Emily Dickinson and Groucho Marx, to name a few; about the last he remarks that his famous dictum, ‘I would not dream of belonging to a club which would have me as a member,’ is a reversal of the Master-Slave paradox, and that it was indeed he who stood Hegel on his head.
Elster can overdo it, and a section of Ulysses about the paradoxes of love betrays, in a memorable phrase of Professor John Findlay, the rattle of machinery. He is also systematically infuriating, because his method in both books is to start questions and not to answer them; to throw out one or two good ideas, not to develop a thesis or sustain an argument for very long. He is interested in the vocabulary of discussions and the ways in which concepts can be put to use in various directions, rather than in solving any given problem. The effect is rather bad for the nerves: in terms which might be appropriate to his own style of paradox, it is like a brisk meditation. Yet it is very clever and inventive, and wonderfully clear; and brings the powerful instruments of modern logic to a rich range of social and psychological issues.
The issue of social contradiction and self-defeating projects occurs in both the books. Logic and Society considers more generally the application of logical notion to social description: the logic of possibility, for instance, as applied to politics, or the logic of ‘counterfactual history’, the activity of considering, for instance, how the USA might have developed without the railway, or the South without slavery (both actual projects of Robert Fogel), a style of thought which seems bafflingly indeterminate yet at the same time is closely associated with causal claims in history which most people want to be able to make. These topics both get pretty short treatment compared with the central topic of ‘counter-finality’, the phenomenon of projects which are doomed to defeat themselves, as Marx believed the processes of capitalist development were bound to do. Elster is good both about the logical structure of such processes and about the various ways in which they have been related to historical development.
Ulysses and the Sirens mainly concerns the rich subject of rational strategies to deal with partial irrationality. The paradigm, revealed in the title, is that of binding oneself so that one will not be able to do things which one foresees oneself doing for bad reasons. Although Elster proceeds, as always, at a cracking pace, there is a lot of insight as well as brilliance in his discussions of this and related subjects. He is particularly good about the phenomenon of ‘time preference’—that is to say, the fact that we characteristically attach more value to the sooner than to the later: a fact which is nervously repudiated by many philosophers, decision theorists, and (in so far as they are not the same people) evangelists of capitalist accumulation.
Besides his formal skills and his vast reading, Elster can bring to these subjects flashes of a distinct historical and political shrewdness. Logic and Society contains, in the middle of a fairly formal discussion of political possibility, some very suggestive remarks about Lenin, Rosa Luxemburg, and the theory of the ‘necessary failure’, in the sense of a failure which is indispensable to the success of the cause.
At three or four points in these books, there are hints of an extremely important idea: that directed and rational practical thought, whether in politics or in individual life—the rehearsing of possibilities, calculation of probabilities, devising alternatives—must for theoretical as well as practical reasons have a limit. This is not just because time or information runs out, but because there are necessary ambivalences of reason which can only be resolved by action rather than by further thought. To the extent that it is indeed a theoretical necessity, this will be a further point at which logical structure and social reality meet one another at some depth. It is one of several which Elster’s plumb-line has touched in his rapid voyage. Let us hope that he will slow down his ship and survey in greater detail these underwater structures of social thought and action.

The Culture of Narcissism, by Christopher Lasch; Nihilism and Culture, by Johan Goudsblom
All around him in American society Lasch sees intellectual and moral feebleness, cultural decay, despair and inner rage.1 There is no personal love, only a snatching at gratification, or domestic skirmishes in the war of all against all. There is no politics, only manipulation; no radical protest, only street theatre; no education, only organised illiteracy. The ‘élitism’ of earlier educational functions has been purged—by robbing the educational process of content. Sport is corrupted into mass entertainment. Therapy has replaced genuine moral reflection, and superstition has replaced genuine therapy.
This jeremiad is illustrated with many well-chosen and sometimes amazing examples of what Lasch detests. He treats some subjects with insight and an effectively energetic indignation; sport is especially well handled, perhaps because it is a rather less familiar theme for articulate cultural critics. But this is an unrelenting and repetitious harangue, with very little effective claim to explain anything, and its considerable success in the United States must surely owe something to its resemblance to the traditional minatory sermon, where the orator’s words furnished the Calvinistic thrill of seeming to reach into one’s own social and moral condition. In this case, however, they do not reach very far. In its attempt to give instant enlightenment about the deepest ills of American society, the book is—to a degree of which Lasch seems surprisingly unaware—an example of its own subject. At the same time, it is a replay of what is, in fact, a very old theme.
Since America has been a modern state, its decay has exercised its moralists. This nostalgia has by no means always had the 18th-century condition of America as its object, but almost always, like so much else in American culture, it has been an expression of 18th-century ideas. This has been particularly true when the resources of primitivism have been deployed, when the idea has been expressed that in some less sophisticated or less complex state of affairs things were—as perhaps they might be again—less dreadful than they are now. Among views of this kind historians of ideas have distinguished in the 18th century a ‘hard’ and a ‘soft’ primitivism, two different celebrations of the Noble Savage. The first, and more familiar, stands for rugged independence, simplicity of taste, loyalty, family virtue, and hardness of body and temper. Soft primitivism, a more socially threatening ideology, was encouraged by early reports from Tahiti, and pictured the uncorrupted state of things in terms of relaxation, gentle plenty, and an entirely amiable promiscuity.
These images have confronted one another in America within the last fifteen years: largely unchanged, except that the hard image has been brought nearer home, to the supposed history of America itself, while the soft image, in the fantasies of flower children and various religionists of pleasure, has been to some degree detached from falsehoods about the South Seas and projected into an accessible alternative culture: one in which, as Lasch points out in his discussion of such faiths, religious discovery and liberation are seen in terms of a technology.
Lasch is assuredly no soft primitivist—and he is not, strictly speaking, a hard one either, since what he sees as lost in contemporary America is a sophisticated urban style of culture, and not the qualities displayed within the ring of ox-waggons. Yet I suspect there is a lot of what he says which speaks to the same sense of loss as that touched by those who pine for a tougher past. Images of hardness, strength, and resistance to elementary oral gratification, run through his book: they are, in fact, largely what holds it together. What is supposed to hold it together is Lasch’s use of the concept of narcissism. There is a certain amount of psychoanalytical discussion which describes in theoretical terms a special kind of character: insecure, dependent on others for self-respect, subject to grandiose images of the self, and filled with anger. This character Lasch explores to some effect: bringing out, for instance, the fact that its baseless self-glorification is quite different from a proper fostering of self, and deftly eliciting its ‘secondary characteristics’: ‘pseudo self-insight, calculating seductiveness, nervous self-deprecating humour’. The total embodiment of modern narcissistic America is, Lasch suggests, Woody Allen.
This account of a kind of character, with its psychoanalytical formulation, offers a good number of suggestions. But it really does little to sustain Lasch’s cultural critique. For this critique to be sustained, a link would be needed between the psychological description and some significant feature of present American society; and since the basic contrast is between the way things are and the way things used to be, some historical understanding is needed of relevant changes in American society. So far as I can discover, there is just one attempt at such an explanation, on page 176: ‘The psychological patterns associated with pathological narcissism, which in less exaggerated form manifest themselves in so many patterns of American culture … originate in the peculiar structure of the American family, which in turn originates in changing modes of production.’ (The radically—or merely historically—disposed reader brightens up.) ‘Industrial production takes the father out of the home and diminishes the role that he plays in the conscious life of the child.’ That is all. The account then goes on to explain how the mother cannot compensate for this, because of various weaknesses which are themselves part of what has to be explained.
Besides that hopeful reference to changing modes of production, there are various other signals in the book to indicate that Lasch is not merely—what he seems a good deal of the time—a disgruntled, though bright conservative. His lament over the decline of the work ethic also includes sneers at the work ethic, and his celebration, as against narcissism, of what are plainly bourgeois virtues tends to steer clear of their association with the bourgeoisie. In the last section of the book, Lasch admits that ‘the conservative critique of bureaucracy superficially resembles the radical critique outlined in the present study.’ He says that this resemblance is only superficial, on the ground, clearly correct in itself, that conservatives have a mythological view of the role of individualism in capitalist business. The content of his own radicalism, however, fizzles out in a sentence or two of almost Bennite vacuity about citizens having to create their own ‘communities of competence’.
Lasch’s complaints suggest no genuine explanation; more generally, for all his admirable concern about preserving a sense of the past, they lack any sense of historical structure. It is no good his just saying that his critique is ‘radical’: unless his account gives some historical meaning to present discontents, it is neither radical nor reactionary, but merely a complaint about present discontents.
This absence of any historical theory, which makes Lasch difficult to distinguish from any nostalgic malcontent of any period, leaves an obscurity over a question which must be central for any critique of modern culture: whether modernity is to be seen as a special category, and modern discontent as unprecedented. Of course, any set of discontents is going to be unprecedented if taken concretely enough: the question is whether the modern world is seen as presenting a crisis—it may also be an opportunity—radically different from anything in past history. Hegel and Marx, of course, took this to be so, and both associated the promise, as well as the distinctive character, of modern culture with its unparalleled degree of self-consciousness. It is a line of thought which lies behind Lasch’s discussion, but it is one which he does not confront. If he had confronted it, he would also have faced the very real question whether, if one accepts that idea, one agrees with the ultimately optimistic interpretations of the phenomenon that Marx and Hegel gave, or sees it as bringing the destruction of European (and American) culture—a return to darkness, or a move to some state of society for which reflective self-consciousness will not be the value that it has been for us.
And here again I touch on my problem, on our problem, my unknown friends (for as yet I know of no friend): what meaning would our whole being possess if it were not this, that in us the will to truth becomes conscious of itself as a problem?
As the will to truth acquires self-consciousness—there can be no doubt of that—morality will gradually perish now: this is the great spectacle in a hundred acts reserved for the next two centuries in Europe—the most terrible, the most questionable, and perhaps also the most helpful of all spectacles.
This, needless to say, is Nietzsche, quoted in Johan Goudsblom’s clear, learned and useful book, which was published in Holland in 1960 and has only now, with revisions, been translated into English.2 It charts the development of nihilism, defined in the sense which Nietzsche gave to the word, and in terms of which he invented, in effect, the contemporary problem of nihilism: ‘A nihilist is a man who judges of the world as it is that it ought not to be, and of the world as it ought to be that it does not exist. According to this view, our existence (action, suffering, willing, feeling) has no meaning: the pathos of “in vain” is the nihilists’ pathos—at the same time, as pathos, an inconsistency on the part of the nihilists.’ The problem lies in the fact that our culture is importantly devoted to the Socratic demand of the ‘truth imperative’ with regard to both ‘being and well being’, as the translators handily put it, and refuses to base action or a way of life on anything less than some absolute truth: at the same time, we acknowledge both that there are no such truths to be had, and that the very consciousness which makes that clear can make it at the same time harder to do without them. Nietzsche again: ‘However, the tragedy is that one cannot believe these dogmas of religion and metaphysics if one has the strict method of truth in one’s heart and in one’s head, whilst on the other hand one has become so tender, so sensitive and so agonised through the development of mankind that one needs remedies and consolations of the most supreme type; this gives rise to the danger of man’s bleeding to death from acknowledged truth … ’
Not all of Goudsblom’s book is about Nietzsche. The parts that are stand up better than much writing about Nietzsche to the danger of having the rest of one’s text discredited by the power of the quotations, and they provide a persuasive account of centrally important aspects of his thought. There is some rather pedestrian history of philosophy in the book—the truth imperative through the centuries—but, in general, under a modest and steady manner, Goudsblom skilfully shapes substantive and illuminating information about nihilism, and makes it clear that both the ‘truth imperative’ itself and scepticism about our ability to satisfy it are cultural and not merely theoretical forces.
At the extremes of his prophetic disgust, Nietzsche did not foresee the precise deformations of social and personal life that Lasch holds up for castigation. But it may be that he understood a great deal about their structure. Was he right in his basic reaction—that the fault must lie with the Socratic aspiration towards moral truth and reflexive understanding? And if so, is there any way of overcoming that drive to ever greater self-consciousness without invoking a catastrophe? These questions are more pressing than ever.

Religion and Public Doctrine in England, by Maurice Cowling
This peculiar book belongs to a series called ‘Cambridge Studies in the History and Theory of Politics’, but one should not be misled by the name either of the series or of the book: there is very little about the history of politics and nothing about its theory, and not much direct light is thrown on the subject of the title.1 Cambridge, however, it very much is. The acerbic parochialism, dislike of the modern world and its cultural effects, a distinct sense of Englishness, indeed put one in mind, oddly enough, of another Cambridge writer, the late Dr Leavis, as do some turgid writing and a violent dislike of Lord Snow. Oddly, since Leavis’s intense moralism is the sort of thing that Cowling most detests: but that only makes it clearer how some spirit of the place managed to affect them both.
Leavis is not mentioned in these pages, but many Cambridge figures, past and present, are. The author relishes the utter inconspicuousness of some of them, and their parochial preoccupations. Welbourne, Smyth and B. L. Manning (author of a chapter on ‘What the Boat Club owes to the College’) all receive considered treatment, alongside better-known historians, and figures such as Whitehead, Toynbee, Eliot, Churchill and Evelyn Waugh. ‘It was not until it began to be said in Jesus that Peterhouse was willing to get rid of Knowles that Butterfield was in a position to persuade Vellacott that Peterhouse had a duty to keep him,’ writes Cowling with relish, and we know where we are.
The parochialism is partly related to an autobiographical intent: the author wishes to introduce us to the formation of his own opinions. However, this is a recessive note, and it comes out rather oddly because the most explicit autobiography occurs in the Preface, in which, by some obscure authorial convention, Cowling always refers to himself in the third person. ‘For as long as he can remember the author has hated these modes of thinking,’ he rather grandly says in the course of it. It must be said that what precedes this remark is not so much an account of any modes of thinking as a list of names (including, I should no doubt declare, my own), and that this sets the tone for quite a lot of what happens later.
Cowling’s idea is to mark out a certain set of dislikes, opinions and attitudes, both by the intermittent element of autobiography, and by an account and assessment of these various writers. The treatment of them is very uneven and often very blank, particularly because so much of it takes the form of fragmented quotations from their writings. The device of quotation and semi-quotation has a function, and allows Cowling to sustain an ambiguous relation to what he is reporting. We shall come back to that. Merely stylistically, it has a deadening effect, particularly when Cowling is trying to deal with philosophical rather than historical writings: the account of Whitehead, for instance, and in good part that of Collingwood, are about as appealing and lifelike as a police photo-montage of a wanted man.
All these writers, and the teachings of the forgotten dons, whether favourably or unfavourably treated, bear on the question of how the modern world should be viewed in the light of the religious consciousness; and the answer is that, at any rate, it should not be viewed as it usually is—within the pious and fraudulent constraints of liberal and humanist preoccupations. ‘How shall we sing the Lord’s song in a strange land?’ was the title, mentioned by Cowling, of a sermon by Owen Chadwick, Regius Professor of History at Cambridge, and the object of some of Cowling’s more condescending comments. In view of the prominent confessional stance that Cowling has chosen to take in this book, the question presses heavily on Cowling himself.
His colleague Edward Norman, who recently voiced in his Reith Lectures prejudices similar to Cowling’s, is criticised for the ‘wavering and inadequate expression that he gives to his conception of the Church of England’, and it is said that he ‘is in danger of abandoning—perhaps wishes deliberately to abandon—the only claims that make it possible to believe that the Church of England is a Church.’ If the proprieties of Peterhouse permit it, Norman might point out that this is a bit thick from one who spends 450 pages in giving barely any idea of what these claims might be, or of the ways in which the Anglican embers might be kept glowing if not with the secularist hot air which he and Cowling jointly despise: Cowling may well reply that the second and ‘larger’ work which he promises will set out all these matters. If so, it will have a hard time.
At the end of this volume, at any rate, it is clear that Cowling’s thoughts, when they extract themselves from the activities of merely quoting, commenting and sneering, are in a state of such abject confusion, and his relation to what he believes is so evasive, that some special infusion of intellectual and spiritual grace will be needed for him to do better than Norman, or to feel his own situation more clearly.
Anglicanism seems indeed to be the preferred form of his ‘Christian conservatism’, and that certainly fits well with his praise of splenetic military men and cantankerous parsons. But the hints we are given of the sentiments at the heart of his religious attitude seem to suggest some different and darker associations—nearer the scepticism and distrust of all merely secular improvement which can be found in the unliberated heartland of the Church of Rome. If all that one’s religion offers is a sense of original sin, imperfectibility, and a recognition that eternity is ‘as significant as time’; if one joins to that a scathing dislike of all liberal improvement; and if one is prepared to say that ‘in face of the transcendence of God, no moral or political system has any authority, and more or less anything will do,’ then one needs some extra agency to keep one from immediate and close association with the more unreconstructed sort of cardinal.
Anglicanism has presumably offered in the past such an agency in the form of certain relations to and within society, ways of going on in a predominantly English style. No dogma or even image of religious truth adequately determines, in this tradition, the religious life: historical contingency, social ‘arbitrariness’ (one of Cowling’s favourite words), must give it substance. But the more that that is true, and the less that there is anything to work with other than what we historically and arbitrarily have, the less room Cowling or any other critic has to object to what we historically and arbitrarily have at any given time—for instance, now.
In a very brief epilogue to his book, Cowling says that Christian conservatism, for the moment, ‘most certainly in England, must primarily exist as dissent, a Jacobitism of the mind, which can do little more than protest its conviction that the modern mind is corrupt.’ But all minds, in Cowling’s lapsarian perspective, are corrupt. In order to show that the modern mind is in some peculiar way corrupt—and in a way of which he, and Christianity, and conservatism, are supposed to give us some improved understanding—he needs a more reflective, more open and less defensive conception of truth than any that he displays here, or indeed, I believe, possesses; and not only of truth, but of truthfulness.
One of Cowling’s objections to the liberal consciousness lies in its pretensions to objectivity, and in particular to historical objectivity. One of the things that the admired Canon Smyth is said to have ‘done’ ‘pedagogically’ is that he ‘implied’ ‘that academic detachment is nonsense and that all academic statements are shot through with prejudice, partiality, and persuasive intention.’ Objections to what is called ‘the constricting positivism of professional historical truth’—like enemies of liberalism to the left, Cowling uses ‘positivist’ as a fairly general term of abuse—yield a poorly defined relativism, about which we are told not much except that it is a necessary defence of religion. Concerning what he learnt from Sir Edwyn Hoskyns, he writes, in a passage which is fairly typical of this book’s prose: ‘But I do not think, in terms of emotional engagement (let alone in terms of religious practice), that I grasped the connection that Hoskyns was making between the religion he was protecting and the relativism that he was using to demolish the Liberalism he thought was eroding it.’ And of Toynbee, a special and early enemy, he says that he failed to see that ‘what is needed is the realisation that relativism subverts eclecticism, that irony protects religion, and that reactionary bloodiness is needed for survival.’
But if historical truth is relative, and religious truth either is totally remote from the world or is embodied in circumstances which are themselves relative and arbitrarily shaped, then it becomes utterly unclear, not merely what the exact objection to liberalism is, but why there is an objection at all. It has, after all, been rather successful, a point which Cowling in his rather unconvincing guise of defiant Jacobite is only too ready to make, and he has left himself with little alternative to being overwhelmingly impressed by that fact. Cowling’s own historical work mainly consists in illuminating the very small-scale politics of British history in this century by detailed use of quotations from documents, in a manner broadly unflattering to the motives of the agents involved. These studies, and the view of men and politics which is suggested by this book, hardly permit him any room for surprise that public life, particularly English public life, contains a high measure of humbug, and if that humbug is indeed effective, there is not much left, on Cowling’s own premises, for the knowing and disillusioned old warrior to do, except to straighten the medals on his shabby greatcoat and salute it.
Perhaps, at the end of the line, it is not any public inadequacy of liberalism which Cowling has the right to deplore, nor even a public deceitfulness, but rather that the high-minded propounders of liberal ideals, the self-satisfied advocates of ‘procrustean virtue’, as he occasionally puts it, are self-deceived. But, once more, if that implies, as it surely must, that they are blinded to the reality of the world, then we need a rather more adventurous and certainly less relativist account of the reality that they conceal from themselves.
Cowling’s posture, assumed with a self-conscious reticence, is one of realism, irony, courage, patience and withdrawn anger; and it implies, as against the liberal pieties, a style of personal truthfulness. It is, then, interesting to see what happens when Cowling gets near, for once, to an opinion which is indeed unacceptable in enlightened circles, which is more specific than his usual target of humanitarian claptrap in general, and which he himself residually suspects to be odious. Here his unheroic use of quotations can give itself away: a clear example is provided by what, in his discussion of Enoch Powell, he euphemistically calls the question of ‘immigration’.
In discussing immigration, Powell was careful not to express hostility to immigrants. In demanding a reduction in their numbers, he claimed to be defending their interests. He did not propose forcible repatriation, nor was his position a ‘racial’ one. He claimed simply that the national identity was in danger …
In the first sentence of this, Cowling is for once outside his usual hedge of quotation, and the robust commentator on this rough world immediately finds himself explaining, with an unction worthy of the purest liberal, what Powell was careful not to express, as opposed, presumably, to what his words were taken to express. In the next sentence, however, Powell only ‘claimed’ to be defending the immigrants’ interests, while, in the sentence after that, the word ‘racial’ collects a pair of quotes, the moral and intellectual force of which remains wonderfully unexplained. Finally, Powell turns out to have claimed ‘simply that the national identity was in danger’. That ‘simply’ is unambiguously Cowling’s, and it would be worth knowing in more forthright terms how simple a matter this sceptical historian of political behaviour takes ‘national identity’ to be.
There is nothing very remarkable in someone’s entertaining these opinions, and Cowling’s doing so is less important (as Cowling would certainly admit) than Powell’s. What is tiresome is the tone of heroic truthfulness with which Cowling throughout this book invests an undertaking of sustained equivocation: often, in an evasive relation to what he quotes, and all the time with an implied reliance on views of society, salvation and history which he smugly holds, rarely states and could not coherently defend.
Cowling seems to have the odd belief that (leaving aside the workers, who are thought to have got a number of things right) only he and the various reactionaries, famed or dim, whom he praises have noticed that much liberalism is optimistic and high-minded claptrap which carries its own intolerances, that survival needs irony, that values conflict, that most things in the world are determined by force and fraud, that political moralism is often self-indulgent, that progressivist utilitarianism is a barren creed. He should be better-informed: these things have got out, and many have noticed them. There are, however, two differences at least between others who have noticed these things, and Cowling. One difference is that some others regard these facts as part of the present historically-given problems of political thought and action, and in trying nevertheless to think and act, exercise that irony which Cowling so much commends—with the aim, for instance, of defending the conceptions of truth and objectivity which he himself both needs and despises. Cowling indeed admits that modernity has, in effect, to be accepted. It is merely superficial of him to suppose that those who equally ‘accept’ modernity, but instead of sitting in colleges writing clotted and ill-natured books, seek to shape its requirements in slightly better rather than worse directions, are necessarily victims of its more flatulent ideologies, or any less command the ‘toughness, subtlety and illusionlessness’ which he claims to use merely in living out the modern world.
Another difference is that those others may extend their lack of illusion to eternity, and to the supposed meanings provided by Christianity. It is indeed one of the oddest, and no doubt in this case consciously acknowledged, ironies of Cowling’s outlook that the ruthless critic of complacency should want, so it seems, to slump onto the dusty hassocks of an older Anglicanism. But I wonder, in fact, how far he does want that, or how far some larger irony may encompass that advocacy as well. The religion in question is so little defined, and its relation, even potential, to our society—that relation mentioned in the title of the book—is so underdetermined, that one may legitimately wonder how far it may not be the vehicle rather than the inspiration of Cowling’s rancour. His repeated claim is that irony is now necessary to Christianity: but it may merely be that the deployment of Christianity proves useful to sarcasm.

Nietzsche on Tragedy, by M. S. Silk and J. P. Stern; Nietzsche: A Critical Life, by Ronald Hayman; Nietzsche, vol. 1, The Will to Power as Art, by Martin Heidegger
Nietzsche’s first book, The Birth of Tragedy, was published in 1872, when he was 27, and while he was a Professor of Classics at Basel. It had the unusual effect, for him, of attracting some attention at the time of its appearance: after that, Nietzsche’s writings virtually ceased to be noticed until the 1890s, by which time he was, for the last 11 years of his life, insane, virtually without speech, and out of touch with the world.
Nietzsche said to his sister that this book was a ‘centaur’, a description which emphasises its oddness, underestimates its beauty, and misleads about the number of its components, since it is a blend not only of scholarship and literary prose, but of philosophy and assertive aesthetic judgment. It makes some historical claims in answer to an old question, the origin of tragedy among the Greeks; more importantly, it tries to characterise the nature of the Greek view of the world, how that is expressed in Greek tragedy, and what significance both that view and those plays can now have.
According to Nietzsche, two contrasting spirits stand over Greek, and over all genuine, art—Apollo and Dionysus. Apollo represents order, civilisation and the determinate image; Dionysus represents nature, fertility, rapture, and the dissolution of individuation into collective expression. Greek tragedy was a highly stylised and formal art which arose nevertheless from the cult of Dionysus, and at its highest, in Nietzsche’s view, it represents a peculiar moment at which the forces of Apollo and Dionysus were balanced—a balance which expresses a heroic understanding and acceptance of the destructive horror of things, a ‘pessimism of strength’.
These elements, the Dionysiac and the Apollonian (a term surely preferable to Silk and Stern’s ‘Apolline’), by no means merely represent, as they are often taken to do, a dichotomy of passion and reason, or of emotion and form. The basic element of the Dionysiac is indeed Rausch—‘rapture’ in Krell’s translation of Heidegger, ‘ecstasy’ in Silk and Stern—but the corresponding idea of the Apollonian is dream, and the order which Classical art can set upon things itself has roots in a realm of illusion. The balance between these forces, and the consciousness which the tragic outlook involves of the unity of destructive and creative forces, was embodied only in the earlier period of the Greek Classical Age—above all, in the tragedians Aeschylus and Sophocles. Of these, Nietzsche tends to emphasise Aeschylus, who was indeed the earlier, but (as Silk and Stern point out) it is certainly Sophocles who most clearly and unpityingly embodies what Nietzsche had in mind.1
The third great tragedian, Euripides, destroyed tragedy, according to Nietzsche, or rather helped it to destroy itself, in association with the spirit of Socrates, that spirit of ‘Alexandrian optimism’ which trusted in reason to make the most basic questions of living into matters of discursive knowledge. That same rationalistic optimism led inevitably to a depreciation of art, including Plato’s celebrated rejection of it. The Platonic consciousness, and the later forms of moralism which in various ways Nietzsche assimilated to it, could not stand the power of tragedy, nor the metaphysical conclusion which, in The Birth of Tragedy, Nietzsche saw as implicit in tragedy: that ‘only as an aesthetic phenomenon can existence and the world be eternally justified.’
That conclusion, like other elements of his earlier thought, was a response to Schopenhauer. An admiring interest in this thinker was one of the things Nietzsche shared with Wagner, with whom, at the time of this book, his association was at its closest, though he was later to break it off, in a reaction of independence which was self-protective and entirely necessary. One of the many interesting facts in Hayman’s detailed and scholarly biography is that Nietzsche was present at the Wagner house on the famous occasion on Christmas Day 1870 when Richter and 15 musicians played on the staircase Wagner’s birthday offering to Cosima, the piece later to be known as the Siegfried Idyll.2 References to Wagner and to his art are present in The Birth of Tragedy, both in the salutation of Act Three of Tristan (a work which Nietzsche knew only from the piano score) as a modern embodiment of the tragic spirit, and, a good deal more problematically, in the form of echoing Wagner’s own hope that his art might be the focus of a national consciousness, in some way comparable to the spirit of the Dionysiac Festivals at which the tragedies were performed.
Silk and Stern, the one a Classical scholar, the other a Professor of German Literature who has already written a rewarding book on Nietzsche, have produced a joint commentary on this remarkable work, which gives a vast amount of background information and relevant comment. They tell of the traditionally German sense of exile, Heimweh, from the ancient world, and of a fascination with Greece which went back to the 18th century, in the form of an image which Nietzsche, more than any other single writer, was to destroy: that of an untroubled, serene world of Attic sunshine. They explain how the book came to be written, and the controversy which surrounded its appearance—in particular, the ferocious attack on it by a scholar younger than Nietzsche, later to become the most famous Classicist of his time, Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Möllendorff, whose savage pamphlet, often right about details and mostly wrong about the larger issues, may have helped to produce the fortunate effect of Nietzsche’s becoming a philosophical writer rather than remaining a philologist—though he was already set on that course before he published The Birth of Tragedy. Their commentary also provides information about such matters as the German understanding of tragedy; Nietzsche’s Classical scholarship as displayed in the book, and how that now appears; and what Nietzsche himself later came to think of it.
The composite authorship has probably contributed to the book’s being longer than it needs to be, and there are some sections of it—that on Aristotle’s Poetics, for instance, rarely an inspiring subject—which are distinctly dutiful. They have between them permitted a slightly schoolmasterly tone at times, both in summary of useful points, and also in some of their criticisms of Nietzsche: ‘Even here, we must admit, [Nietzsche] is liable to indulge his own inventive powers at the expense of his nominal subject.’ But many of the criticisms are well taken and the book judiciously offers (to those who can afford it) a great deal of useful information, organised round a wonderful subject. The only really mad assertion it contains, so far as I can see, is that in the operas of Mozart ‘music and drama merely alternate.’
In his last active years, Nietzsche came to take a poor view of much of The Birth of Tragedy. In 1886, he brought out an edition which had a new preface and a new subtitle. It was no longer The Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music but The Birth of Tragedy: or Hellenism and Pessimism. The Preface was called ‘Attempt at a Self-Criticism’. To some degree, Nietzsche exaggerated the degree of his distance from the content of the book, which contained some of the most fundamental ideas of his later work, even though it is true that he had little use later for the contrast of the Apollonian and the Dionysiac, nor did he take any further great interest in drama. Much of the self-criticism of the Preface is, in a searching sense, stylistic: ‘Today I find it an impossible book: I consider it badly written, ponderous, embarrassing, image-mad and image-confused, sentimental, in places saccharine to the point of effeminacy, uneven in temper, lacking the will to logical exactitude, quite convinced and therefore disdainful of proof, mistrustful even of the propriety of proof, a book for initiates … ’ And the Wagnerian aspiration had gone: ‘Meanwhile I have learned to look without any hope or mercy on this “German spirit”, and also on contemporary German music, which is romanticism through and through, and which, apart from being the most un-Greek of all possible art-forms, is also a first-rate poison for the nerves, doubly dangerous for a nation which loves drink, and honours unclarity as a virtue … ’
Granted these remarks and many like them from Nietzsche’s later years, granted his attitude to pretentious obscurity and professorial self-importance, he really did not deserve Heidegger’s lectures on him. Heidegger offered four lecture courses on Nietzsche at the University of Freiburg-im-Breisgau between 1936 and 1940. The present volume is the first of four volumes in English translation to be published, and carries an analysis by the translator, who clearly knows a great deal about Heidegger, can nevertheless write clearly, and might well have extended himself beyond the very limited role that he has taken.3
These lectures are directed to the same area as The Birth of Tragedy, but they barely mention the work. In all these lectures, it seems, Heidegger took as his text a book called The Will to Power, which is, in fact, a collection of aphorisms and notes, of very different dates, which Nietzsche’s dreadful sister, the energetic anti-semite Elisabeth, put together from his Nachlass according to an outline—only one of many different such plans—which Nietzsche had written on one sheet of paper for a book of that title. The Will to Power is a deeply interesting and powerful collection of writings, but it is not really a book by Nietzsche at all, let alone his definitive work. The idea that that was what it was was propagated in the Thirties by Alfred Bäumler, who wrote postscripts to editions of Nietzsche’s work and was a Nazi. Heidegger, it must be said, honourably repudiates in this volume Bäumler’s Hitlerian interpretations, but he accepts Bäumler’s account of the nature of the book called The Will to Power; nor is there any correcting comment by Krell, although he refers to the English translation by Kaufmann and Hollingdale (Weidenfeld, 1968), where Kaufmann’s Preface sets out these matters in detail.
Heidegger has one or two interesting things to say—for instance, about the relations of Will and Power to Romanticism. He gives some suggestive interpretations, as when he suggests that Nietzsche’s claim of ‘philosophising with a hammer’ means, not smashing things, but to ‘tap all things with a hammer to hear whether or not they yield that familiar hollow sound’. Some other interpretations are interesting without being convincing, as when he says that Nietzsche’s claim that ‘we have art in order not to perish of the truth’ refers to supersensible or transcendental ‘truth’ of the kind falsely offered by optimistic Platonist philosophers—a version which seems precisely to take the edge off Nietzsche’s thought. Nietzsche did not remain satisfied with the redeeming power of art as expressed in The Birth of Tragedy, but that left him with the problem which the formulation had tried to answer—of the relations between the power of art and the demands, if not of truth, at least of truthfulness. Heidegger discusses at length what Nietzsche called the ‘holy dread of the discordance of art and truth’—but only, so it seems to me, to disappear, when the going gets tough, into abstract nouns and gnomic metaphysical evasion.
Heidegger is the only world-famous philosopher of the 20th century about whom it can seriously be argued that he was a charlatan, not because he is obscure, but because it can seem that his obscurity is functional, and that his characteristic combination of an abstract metaphysical terminology with homely domestic metaphor (so that things ‘stand in the clearing of Being’ or such) is not a necessity born of the unequalled depth of his inquiry—something to which he insistently refers—but a purposive substitute for thought which in more perspicuous modes is harder. I genuinely do not know whether such critics are right, but these lectures at least, less densely written and so in some ways more revealing than his more finished publications, do little to disarm them.
There are passages, some quite long, about the history of philosophy, in particular about Plato, which are sometimes utterly dull and banal, and sometimes simply inaccurate: often past writers are tacitly bent to a Heideggerian purpose, ‘a philosophy for initiates’. His use of ‘therefore’ startlingly ‘lacks the will to logical exactitude’: indeed, most of his discursively presented arguments are the dialectical equivalent (to adapt a phrase of Wittgenstein’s), not of a clock that tells the time wrongly, but of a heap of junk. Perhaps that was his intention—to provide an affronting propaedeutic to real, non-discursive, philosophy. Heidegger’s work on Nietzsche has been influential, particularly in France, but to me these lectures seem to do no good to the understanding of Nietzsche, nor to gain anything from it, but mainly to be a hideous example of several things that Nietzsche explicitly and rightly hated.
It is certain, even if not everyone has yet come to see it, that Nietzsche was the greatest moral philosopher of the past century. This was, above all, because he saw how totally problematical morality, as understood over many centuries, has become, and how complex a reaction that fact, when fully understood, requires. To help himself to understand it, he resourcefully explored, in twenty years of increasingly hectic activity, our feelings about art, guilt, violence, honesty, and indeed every element of that moral consciousness which the Greeks helped to invent.
It is not easy to write a book about Nietzsche. Two of the present books succeed, one as a learned and critical commentary on one special work, the other by offering great biographical learning and only modest philosophical ambitions. Heidegger in this volume does not display much learning, and no one can ever have supposed that his philosophical ambitions were modest. But above all it is in its style, in its lack of light and its dire assertiveness, that it shows no sign of having grasped the demands that Nietzsche managed to impose on anyone wanting to write about him, or about the subjects that he transformed.

After Virtue: A Study in Moral Theory, by Alasdair MacIntyre
MacIntyre’s brilliant and deeply interesting book starts from a truth which is, as he says, not as obvious as some of its effects—that modern morality is in a mess.1 The mess does not consist simply in the fact that there are many moral conflicts which we find it difficult to resolve. The point is rather that there are no agreed ways of thinking about these conflicts, so that claims of justice, for instance, stand in blank opposition to claims based on utility and welfare, and we do not know how to weigh arguments in terms of what people deserve or need against considerations of general happiness. Indeed, we do not even know how to think straight about what they deserve or need.
MacIntyre’s explanation of this is that we are surrounded by disconnected fragments of a previously working morality, which has been progressively deprived of sense by the demands of modern society and its impersonal organisation. Such a society offers an intolerable opposition between a bureaucratic and technical world on the one hand, and mere privacy, the world of the individual, on the other. This encourages us to think of ourselves, in relation to morality, in purely individualist terms, and as not essentially related to any social structure or institutional duties. This utterly abstract picture of the moral self is shared by analytical philosophy, by Sartre, and by many social scientists. It is in fact only a reflection of our alienated social condition.
The only choice now left to us, MacIntyre claims, is between Aristotle and Nietzsche. The latter discovered the historical collapse of traditional substantial conceptions of morality, and was prepared to face the consequences (or some of the consequences) of there being no coherent basis to moral thought. If we do not accept that, we must try to reconstruct morality on the kind of basis offered by Aristotle, according to which the virtues constitute the central notion.
MacIntyre opts for Aristotle. He gives some account of how virtues relate to rules of society, and sketches foundations for a morality grounded in the virtues, by using the three notions of “a practice,” “a narrative order” (which can constitute a whole human life), and “a moral tradition” which allows room for conflict and criticism. This new Aristotelianism will be free, he hopes, from defects which he rightly points out in Aristotle’s own theory—for instance, that it implausibly implies that you cannot have any one virtue unless you have all of them.
Aristotle himself, of course, essentially connected morality and politics: the proper life for man can be lived only in a proper society. MacIntyre deeply agrees, and this is indeed one of his major claims; but at the same time he regards the situation of modern society as so hopeless that the new morality can be lived, for the time being, only on a private scale (it seems), and the book ends with a few brief and bewildering remarks in favour of St Benedict and Trotsky, offered so desultorily as to suggest that, as he wrote them, MacIntyre was packing to depart.
Much of MacIntyre’s construction goes by very fast indeed, and one repeatedly wants to stop it with questions. But the feeling is sustained that one’s question would get an interesting answer. Sometimes the jumps in the argument leave one with too little grasp even on what the theory is supposed to effect: I find this so with the treatment of narrative structure, where the relations of fiction to reality, and of prospective decisions to retrospection, remain firmly hidden in dazzling light.
The book is in fact a collection of highly suggestive pieces which are sometimes skilfully juxtaposed rather than connected by argument. One piece is particularly thinly connected to the rest. This treats the well-worn theme of the scientific unpredictability of social developments. It is supposed to earn its place by undermining claims made by managers to legitimate power in modern society in virtue of their powers of bureaucratic control, but it cannot possibly do this, since MacIntyre’s own argument allows—it may indeed require—that there is such a thing as successful bureaucratic control, and all the argument can show is that it is not grounded in scientific prediction.
Some aspects of MacIntyre’s diagnosis, and of his reconstruction, are, of course, not entirely new. It is surprising that he does not refer, among recent writers, to Charles Taylor, for instance, who in his book on Hegel (a writer himself neglected by MacIntyre) and elsewhere has expressed similar concerns. But After Virtue is still an original, as well as a compelling and imaginative book, and the major doubts that it raises are doubts on major issues. Much of MacIntyre’s accounts of the virtues, and his claim that modern moral thought is deeply in a mess in a way that current philosophy is not equipped to understand, are surely correct.
But I find it hard to believe his historical diagnosis. Above all, it is surely not merely an effect of alienated modern society that we have the conception of a pure moral self which, abstracted from all social institutions, is able to stand back from, accept or reject any proposed pattern of affections or allegiances. On the contrary, this is an idea which has recurred in different forms at various points in the history of morality, in Plato and in certain forms of Christianity as well as in Kant. It itself represents, in fact, a certain moral demand—a demand of justice, that one should lay aside, in the search for ultimate moral worth, the determinations of society. What value you possess, it suggests, cannot ultimately depend on where, or who, in what social conditions, you were born.
Aristotle indeed does not have that idea; but it is not that the world in his time had not yet faced that demand, but that he seems to have forgotten it. Similarly, he seems to have forgotten the problem about vindicating morality against egoism, a problem which MacIntyre very oddly displaces to the 18th century, although it was manifestly faced by Plato and by Socrates at the very beginning of the Western tradition.
In its historical aspects, MacIntyre’s account is a brilliant nostalgic fantasy. What we have now is not so much the collapse of a fine Aristotelian tradition under the deformations of the modern world, but rather the outcome, under those modern pressures, of faults which have always existed in the Western moral consciousness. If, at our present juncture, we do have to choose between Aristotle and Nietzsche, it may rather be Nietzsche who is right: it has finally got out that there is something wrong with morality. But it is itself one of MacIntyre’s most illuminating exaggerations to claim that this is the only choice that we have.

Philosophical Explanations, by Robert Nozick
Toward the end of his talented, diverse, and very long book, Robert Nozick embraces the idea of philosophy as an art form, and of the philosopher as a literary creator who works with ideas.1 This reinforces an idea that may have already occurred to the reader; if this book is in some way like a literary work, it is clear what kind of literary work it is like.
Nozick, when young, wrote several articles of startling brilliance, originality, and, in some cases, formidable technical resource, in such fields as the formal discipline of decision theory. He then produced the notorious Anarchy, State, and Utopia, a lengthy book which advocated individual rights, libertarianism, and a minimal state; attacked public welfare; discouraged redistributive social justice; and represented taxation as forced labor. It was very clever and not very pious, and gave a distinct impression of hard-talking heartlessness (though the genuinely heartless publicists of the right who welcomed it as a philosophical liberation failed to notice that Nozick was committed, most probably, to believing that most of America belongs to the Indians).
After the hard, scandalous success we should not be too surprised to find now a book that has deeper and more spiritual ambitions, which covers many large traditional subjects, and which devotes the same outstanding talents not just to solving puzzles or showing off, and not at all to slamming the pious, but to reaching toward more speculative and awesome reflections on the meaning of life. This is Philosophical Explanations. It is an attempt at the Great American Novel of philosophy.
Like most other such attempts, it fails. It is an extraordinary mixture. In part, it is as brilliant and exciting as anything in contemporary philosophy. Quite often it is suggestive and interesting. Sometimes it is very bad, and at moments it is so deeply awful that it is only by considering the Great American Novel syndrome that one can see how it came about. A feature of that syndrome is the disposition to take the size of the attempt for success itself. That can affect readers as well as the writer. Many large things have already been said about this book by commentators. One is that it introduces new philosophical techniques, and is likely to influence the way in which philosophy is done.
Nozick does offer some claims to a distinctive method, but he sensibly makes much less of his originality in this respect than the commentators do. The idea, borne by his title, is that philosophy should try to explain things, rather than offer proofs. It is not altogether clear what he means by this distinction. He wants to avoid “coercing” people with attempted proofs to inescapable conclusions; he does not want to proceed by rigorous deduction from self-evident premises. But it is not obvious how that aim is related to offering explanations: some explanations (some mathematical ones, for instance) themselves proceed in that way. He recommends something else again when he tells us to proceed in a tentative rather than a dogmatic spirit—there can be tentative suggestions of proofs, and there can be dogmatic explanations. Nor is any of this the same as the aspiration, which he also expresses, to make a philosophical work that is more like the many-columned Parthenon than like a tall, thin tower, so that when bits fall down, as they will, something of beauty may be left. That analogy poses the question, not whether the work consists of proofs, but whether it all consists of one proof.
One kind of thing Nozick’s various distinctions do exclude: a philosophical work that tries to deduce all its conclusions from a few axioms. That is excluded, but then virtually no philosophy has been like that. Spinoza claims to have done that in his Ethics, but no one believes him. At the very beginning of Western philosophy, Parmenides’ poem (or half of it) may have tried to do that, but it is hard to tell from its ruins—except that they seem more like the ruins of a temple than of a tower.
In fact, almost all past philosophy has consisted of explanations, and has been known by its authors to do so. Plato’s did, and the word aitia, the Greek for “explanation,” is closely associated with its most notorious speculative construct, the Theory of Forms. Aristotle was obsessionally explicit in offering explanations. Even the rationalist Descartes can be seen as, much of the time, explaining—and he was aware, in the case of physics (at least), of something to which Nozick draws attention, the power of explanations that one knows to be untrue. Kant was centrally engaged in explanation: explaining, as Nozick reminds us, how something can be so (for instance, that every event must have a cause), but also, and very illuminatingly, how we can seem to be forced to believe things that are absurd or impossible. Kant and other philosophers, such as Wittgenstein, have believed something that Nozick mentions but does not in fact attend to very much in this book: that a good philosophical explanation, insofar as it corrects everyday belief, carries with it an explanation also of error, and of why incorrect everyday belief should seem true.
There are perhaps two distinctive things that Nozick particularly has in mind in emphasizing explanation as against “coercive” proof. He is telling us, for one thing, that philosophers should entertain ideas in a patient and imaginative manner, and not treat them, or those who offer them, as the local heavies in a Western movie treat the stranger in town. It is not the most creative approach in philosophy to shoot an idea out of someone’s hand as soon as he picks it up. Here Nozick’s conclusion is fine and good. Not everyone needs to be told it.
The second thing that Nozick encourages goes further and is less good. This—which emerges much more in the later part of the book, about value—is the idea that a philosophical conception recommends itself if, as well as fitting a number of our spontaneous practices of thought and feeling, it would be nice if it were true. At times, Nozick starts at quite a distance from the facts and constructs a model of how things might be, the main point of which seems to be that the world would be a better and less squalid place if that were how things turned out to be. Thus he offers a picture in which we have a dignity that lies in possessing genuine free will; in which there is an objective world of values that are not created, though they are in some way brought to life, by our thought; in which these cosmic values are what give meaning to life.
These are not contemptible ideas, and Nozick does not merely assert them. He puts them to some explanatory work—though that work is rather narrowly conceived—and he argues about them in some detail. But what gives the ideas their initial impetus does not lie in any explanatory power—at least any beyond their effortless ability to match the conviction we may have, some of us more than others, that we have the dignity of undetermined free will and that there are objective values. What launches them is the feeling that everything would be higher and more inspiring if things conformed to Nozick’s model, and it is that feeling, together with a certain tone (of which more later), that grounds the fear that this book is trying to do a dreadful thing: to lead philosophy back to an aspiration from which the work of this century has done so much to release it, the aspiration to be edifying.
There are some important kinds of philosophical explanation that do not figure enough in these pages. One is that Kantian type of explanation I have already mentioned, the explanation of why what seems to us to be so should seem to be so if in fact it is false. There is a good example of this lack in Nozick’s first section, on the identity of the self. Philosophers have much discussed issues of what differentiates one person from another and what it is for a particular person to continue to exist: is it continuity of body, of character, of memories, or what? An important slant to these questions is given when the perspective is the person’s own. Suppose I am invited to reflect what person in the future would, under various imaginable transformations—e.g., if my memories or character or body should be radically altered—be me. Some philosophers (including myself) have claimed that the following principle applies to such cases: that the question whether a certain person in the future, let us call him Y, is the same as a person present now, X, cannot be a question of whether Y is merely the best candidate available at the time for being X.
Imagine two different states of affairs five years from now. In one of them, a certain living body, Y (not your present one), has been programmed to have your present memories and character (more or less), and your own present body has been destroyed. In the other state of affairs, Y exists, just the same, but your present body, X, also continues, with the same memories and character. Clearly in the second case, X is you, and Y is not. Y is just a copy. Does that mean that Y cannot be you in the first case either? I and others have argued that it does mean that. Nozick denies this, and claims that who one will be in the future depends on the available candidates. In the first case, you will be Y, since there is no better candidate; in the second case, you will not be Y, since there is a better candidate. He calls this the “closest continuer” theory of (personal) identity.
Nozick actually claims to show that the principle that he rejects is false, by producing a counterexample. This strays a bit, early in the book, from the protocol of eschewing proof, but in the event he does not stray far, since the counterexample is feeble and proves nothing. (It concerns a group of émigré philosophers who will be the Vienna Circle if there is no other and larger group of émigré philosophers elsewhere, but will not be if there is. But a group of persons is not the same sort of thing as a person. “Are you the Vienna Circle?” the welcoming committee asks. “At least some of it,” the émigrés might reasonably reply.)
More interestingly, Nozick proceeds to find other kinds of philosophical issues which, he claims, have a similar structure, for example, the analysis of justice, or the meaning of sentences. This is worthwhile, and sheds light on a number of questions. But even if this is so, it will not answer the question that many will feel most needs answering: how can this be the right answer for personal identity? How can it be that the question whether I should fear for what happens to some future person (supposing that I care about myself) should depend on whether someone else has been killed off who would have had a better claim to being me if he had survived? Perhaps the question can be answered, but it is not answered here, and it certainly needs to be. If what Nozick claims is true, then some things that we very deeply believe about personal identity are false. We believe, for example, that our claims to personal identity do not depend on who else is around. And what needs philosophical explanation is why we believe them. That explanation would also help us to think straight about our future without believing those things.
One of Nozick’s objectives is to respect and make sense of deep metaphysical and, in some cases, religious motivations that express themselves not only in some unschooled reflection but also in a variety of religious and philosophical traditions (he refers quite often to Indian thought). His way of confronting these traditional questionings, however, is often somewhat oblique. He takes up the question “Why is there something rather than nothing at all?” This has certainly in many traditions been felt to be a real and puzzling question: to such an extent that well-known attempts in philosophy to show that the question is misconceived tend to seem shallow and unconvincing. Nozick turns the issue into a subtle discussion of the theory of explanation. If it is claimed that a principle is explanatory of everything, can it also explain itself?
This is, once more, an interesting discussion, but the reader may feel that he or she has been left alone to work out the relevance of Nozick’s immense ingenuity and logical inventiveness to the archetypal metaphysical concern which started the discussion off. (The reader, incidentally, will need not only close attention, but also some technical knowledge, to follow Nozick down some of his paths in this book—what a Gödel numbering is, for example.)
By far the most successful section of the book is that on knowledge. This is very vigorous and resourceful, wonderfully clever, and, at a rather technical level, highly instructive. It is also academically the most conventional part of the book and very directly rooted in the recent literature. The argument is at the same time very original in its application. The basic idea is that someone knows something if he “tracks” the truth, where this means, very roughly, (1) that he believes something true, (2) that he wouldn’t believe it if it were not true, and (3) that if it were true, he would believe it—where the last clause adds the idea that not only is it true and he believes it, but his belief is “sensitive” to the truth. By “sensitive,” Nozick refers not to a special capacity of the believer but to the existence of a factual link between a belief and that which the belief is about. This is all worked out in considerable detail and with a subtlety that does not, as often happens in discussions of this subject, lose touch with the point of our having such a concept of knowledge.
The most spectacular result is achieved when this definition is applied to dealings with the skeptic. Nozick writes, “We do not seek to convince the skeptic but rather to formulate hypotheses about knowledge and our connection to facts that show how knowledge can exist even given the skeptic’s possibilities.” The skeptic says, for instance, that we do not know that we’re not in a tank having our brains stimulated by a mad scientist in such a way that it seems to us just as though we were in a room, seeing a table, and so on. So we don’t know that we are in fact seeing a table, even though it seems to be there, in perfect view, and everything seems as it usually does. Nozick says, and derives it from his definition, that we don’t know that we’re not in the tank; we do know that if we’re in the tank, then we are not seeing the table; yet we do know that we’re seeing the table. (Knowledge, in the technical phrase, is “not transitive under known logical implication.”)
This is the one argument that practically no one has used against the skeptic, and it testifies to Nozick’s remarkable discussion that this conclusion, which might seem a desperate device, begins to look natural and plausible. If one wants to know how to deal with skeptics, or indeed what knowledge is, this discussion must be read.
I am less certain that Nozick’s dealings with the skeptic get their strength, as he suggests, from his general objective of substituting explanation for proof. His point, as I’ve said, is that he is not trying to refute the skeptic, that notoriously discouraging task. But even if he is not trying to show the skeptic that the skeptic should not believe (or rather disbelieve) everything that he does, he is trying to show us that we need not accept what the skeptic says. If the skeptic is right, however, we should accept what he says; so the skeptic can’t be right. It is not obvious that those who have attempted to refute the skeptic (notably Descartes) have wanted more than that. But this is not a simple question, and this section is not only one in which the argument comes vividly to life, but also one in which the distinction between explanation and proof may for once be doing some helpful work in its own right.
When this high point of the book ends, we are less than halfway through. All the rest belongs to a division called “Value,” in which such things are discussed as free will, punishment, moral motivation, self-improvement, “the value of valuers,” and the meaning of life.
The section on free will is at several places uncharacteristically hesitant, not just in conclusion, but in direction. This is particularly so in the passage on retributive punishment, a subject on which, it seems to me, if Nozick had applied the same trenchancy as he has done to banging more fashionable views, he might well have given up. Here he attempts another application of the idea of explanation. The aim is not to justify retributive punishment (or to give a retributive justification of punishment), but to give an account of what its underlying ideas are. Nozick starts with some distinctions between revenge and retribution, and gives an elegant account of what an act of retribution is, revealing it as a form of communicative behavior which does not merely hurt but shows someone something. He then considers the simplest view of punishment as “showing” someone—a teleological version of it, in which the aim is to produce a change in the offender by which he comes to recognize his guilt.
There are well-known problems with theories of this kind, which tend to go around in a circle. The painful element, essential to punishment, in such an instructional act seems gratuitous. If the point of hurting a man is to tell him, why not just tell him? Or, if the aim is not just to tell him, but to convince him, the rationale may well become the same as that of reformative punishment. Anyway the rationale will not apply to the unreformable—apart from the point that it will always be an open question whether he might not be more effectively convinced by other means.
So Nozick moves to a wholly nonteleological interpretation, as he hopes, of retributive punishment. The aim of retribution is not merely to produce certain consequences but to do something “right or good in itself.” The aim, as he puts it, is to “connect the offender with correct values,” where this is not an aim that is added on to the act of punishment, but inherent in it. Nozick’s idea is to produce an effect on the offender, not necessarily in him: correct values are given “some significant effect in his life.” But, once again, why painful punishment rather than something else? This, replies Nozick, is necessary for it to be a significant connection with values. Why then should only those who have actually done wrong be so connected with values? Because, Nozick would answer, the wrong they have committed shows them to be not just unlinked, but “anti-linked,” to values. Is this, however, not also true of the dispositionally wicked? But, Nozick claims, if they have not committed acts they have not flouted values, and the aim of retributive punishment is to “replace flouting with linkage.”
The effect of Nozick’s criticism of the old arguments against retribution is simply to have reduced to the smallest possible circumference the circle in which the argument moves. He is not trying to produce a justification of retribution, but he does aim to produce its rationale, and the rationale provided moves round in so tight a circle that it is hard to see how the justification of retribution might eventually be applied. The “role of suffering in punishment,” Nozick says, is “to negate or lessen flouting by making it impossible to remain as pleased with one’s previous anti-linkage.” That version, in fact, is not yet entirely purged of the teleological—for suppose he remains pleased with his previous anti-linkage? But even with that impurity, the account is so utterly wrapped in itself that it is not going to give much insight to anyone who was previously puzzled by the idea of retributive punishment.
Another feature of the discussion of punishment is shared by all the material on value: it is vastly removed from any actual social institution. There are one or two desultory references to the law, but virtually nothing that focuses on the fact that punishment is inflicted by some actual authority in some actual social circumstances. This characteristic, spread over the whole large discussion of value, issues in a level of abstraction that is often bewildering, and which utterly discounts many obligations which one might have thought to be precisely obligations of philosophical explanation.
Value, we are told (I suppose one should rather say: “it is suggested”), consists basically in the degree of “organic unity.” We value, he implies, that which unifies diverse and apparently separate materials or experiences. Not much is done to give content to this old and uninformative proposal. For Nozick, as for earlier writers, it is based on the differing complexities of higher and lower organisms and on some selected considerations about aesthetic objects—despite well-known and indeed obvious difficulties about measuring “organic unity” anywhere, and, in the case of art, when we can supposedly detect it, doubts about necessarily preferring its increase. But such problems do not seem to concern Nozick very much. He is more interested in a set of logical devices dealing with the notion of value in the abstract. He discusses in detail such topics as what would be involved in “tracking bestness,” as he puts it, and “why is being a value-seeker and responder to value qua value itself valuable?”
Very little of this offers a direction to a psychology of moral action. Nor does it stoop to recognize any of the well-known problems raised by social explanations of actual systems of moral value, for example the conflicts between different systems of value in different societies and the difficulty of achieving objectivity in describing or explaining them. Indeed Nozick barely pays much attention to any distinctively human category. The picture we are left with is of the objective cosmic dimension of value as organic unity, with our having the opportunity to link ourselves with this, and by that be transformed and elevated. These salutations to independent values, alternating as they do with very detailed formalistic arguments (on the conflict of obligations, for instance), give the impression of some beautiful nebula, at one time seen through the optical telescope, at another with its light broken down through the spectroscope. There is a difference, however, since a nebula sends light to us, but values are inactive, unless we make them active in and through us. As Nozick puts it, in a very typical passage:
Value seekers and responders have a cosmic role: to aid in the realization of value, in the infusion of value into the material and human realm.
Can that possibly, one begins to wonder, be the way to put it—to put anything?
If we do take up our cosmic role, then we may, according to Nozick, be transformed. One of the most important features of his account, and one that he seems least prone to regard as peculiar, is his emphasis on the notion of spiritual superiority, and indeed on a kind of ressentiment, a destructive and belittling envy that can be aroused by the spiritual superiority of people who, as Nozick sees them, have excelled in this cosmic role. Many of his passages that are most genuinely passionate are about this subject. They have the same note, and the same animus, as was to be found in Anarchy, State, and Utopia on the subject of envy directed toward more mundane forms of superiority. The tone of the present account introduces more than a hint of a competition in spirituality.
There is something very wrong with the way in which these notions are deployed in Nozick’s writing: that is to say, there is something wrong with the writing, and also something wrong with them. The theory itself does not give much content to these ideas of spiritual self-improvement, and the level of generality prevents his giving us any side illumination from the merely historical or psychologically particular. He tries to give us the idea directly, so to speak, and the fact is that we cannot trust him as a messenger from any spiritual height, because by the time that he is fully launched on his cosmic role he not only cannot hear anything that is happening on Earth, but cannot properly listen to himself.
It is not merely a matter of the occasional sententious banality: “It is better and lovelier to be moral”; “imagination has always been a faculty prized by students of literature and art”; “in our own biographies, at least, each of us is the leading character.” Such phrases are alarming enough—as Anthony Burgess’s narrator says in Earthly Powers, “If I could write so blatant a tautology, I could write also of the goodness of evil or the badness of good, and probably, somewhere or other, did.” But it is more generally true that the nearer we get to Nozick’s image of what he calls “spiritually advanced persons”—the arousers of ressentiment in those unwilling to be, as he puts it, “helped along” in this direction—the more his capacity to listen to himself seems to lapse:
There are some individuals whose lives are infused by values, who pursue values with single-minded purity and intensity, who embody values to the greatest extent. These individuals glow with a special radiance. Epochal religious figures often have this quality. To be in their presence (or even to hear about them) is to be uplifted and drawn (at least temporarily) to pursue the best in oneself. There are less epochal figures as well, glowing with a special moral and value loveliness, whose presence uplifts us, whose example lures and inspires us.
There is a lot more of this. There is even more about people glowing. Such writing sounds like Close Encounters of Some Yet Higher Kind, or a commercial for breakfast food. Whether its defects derive from the state of the modern world or from the English language now or (as I believe) from confusion about values, it will not do. And Nozick, even if he has switched off the monitor to Earth, will know, since he is a very good philosopher, that the problem cannot just be a matter of finding some happier way of saying the same thing.
In fact I think that the part of this book that is about value is utterly misconceived, and that the whole enterprise of approaching the problems in this abstract way, virtually unrelated to human psychology or society, and assuming ill-defined and suspect notions of spiritual superiority, is a large error. I do not believe that there is any cosmic role, and I think that Nietzsche was right when he said that philosophy should stick close to the Earth. But even if I am wrong, and there is something to be recovered from such conceptions, it is a basic truth, which Nozick seems not to have encountered at all, that it could not be recovered in these terms, or by such ingenuous methods. It is not a new truth. The wise men to whom Nozick sometimes refers, rabbis, gurus, Zen masters, have known and shown that the cosmic role, if there is one, needs a high measure of irony, personal and indeed cosmic, in order to be presented or interpreted. A craftier route to the beyond will always be needed, if there is a beyond, and the mere combination of cleverness with earnestness is not going to find it.

The Miracle of Theism: Arguments for and against the Existence of God, by J. L. Mackie
The late J. L. Mackie was a notably clear and hard-headed philosopher who brought great powers of argument and a demanding intellectual integrity to a wide range of subjects. He wrote with force and insight about logic, theory of knowledge, philosophy of science, ethics and the history of philosophy, and now, after his early death, which was a great loss to the subject, we have a book in the philosophy of religion.1 It is very largely, as its subtitle claims, a study of arguments for and against the existence of God, though it extends naturally enough, and disapprovingly, to the discussion of some believers who have written in favour of trying to get by without any arguments.
Mackie was an analytic philosopher, but his philosophy was not in any conspicuous or interesting sense linguistic. After all those books of the 1950s and early 60s which took up the “language” of religious belief, it is striking that Mackie dismisses in a line or two problems specifically about the meaning of religious statements. He finds it for the most part fairly obvious what they mean, or at least those that assert or deny the existence of God or express his more general properties; I think that Mackie might have had greater difficulty with the meaning of some more specific Christian claims, such as the Trinity or the Incarnation. Mackie’s problem is not about what it means to say that God exists, but whether it is true, and what reason there is to think it true.
He had in general a great respect for the natural sciences and a lot of his work concerned the relation of the picture of the world that is given by them to our other beliefs and reasoning. In this, too, Mackie differed from linguistic philosophy, though not so much from the logical positivism that preceded it. What his work most resembled, in fact, was a kind of analytical philosophy that preceded both of them, the philosophy of Broad and of Bertrand Russell. It is very much the spirit of Russell—though I do not think that his name is mentioned—that is to be found in this book: a spirit which is rational, sceptical, benevolent and firmly failing to conceal, at crucial moments, contempt for the evasive and hatred for the fanatical.
Mackie differs from Russell inasmuch as his arguments are longer and more careful, the history is more accurate and the finish is a lot less brilliant. There are also far fewer jokes, though Mackie does turn one dry pleasantry about the American philosopher Alvin Plantinga, who is thought by some to have rehabilitated the Ontological Argument by his researches in modal logic: “So perhaps St Alvin will … take his place beside St Anselm; at least he will have no difficulty in meeting the miracle-working requirement for canonization, after the success he has achieved in subverting (as Hume would say) all the principles of the understanding of so many intelligent readers.”
Some of the text seems a little dutiful, and the amount of explanation given to various subjects is sometimes surprising; Berkeley’s arguments, and Descartes’s proof of God from our idea of him, collect a lot of detail, though neither can now seem at all compelling, while, on the other hand, the inexpert reader who wants to consider Plantinga’s claims to sainthood is not given much help with his apparatus of “possible worlds”. But this is a minor oddness of a book which, so far as the arguments of natural theology go, treats them with very great clarity, accuracy and intellectual care. For a detailed and perspicuous account of how it now stands with the First Cause Arguments, the Argument to Design (as Mackie rightly calls it) and the rest, I know of no book that does it better than this, and anyone who thinks that these arguments do anything to strengthen their conclusion has very powerful negative considerations from Mackie to contend with.
What the book does is to deal with those traditional arguments—no less, and, just about, no more. Mackie is above all interested in the arguments, and, more than that, he loses interest in those defenders of religious belief who are not themselves interested in arguments. He says that he prefers the “clarity and honesty” of classical works on this subject, and among present philosophers of religion who are believers, he prefers and often discusses the work of Richard Swinburne, a writer of similar temper, who also considers God’s existence as a hypothesis to be assessed, and who is prepared to give a judicious estimate of such things as the probability, if God exists, that he should have created a physical universe. Mackie, in the later part of his book, does engage with some writers who treat the subject in a less rationalistic spirit, but, with the exception of William James, they do not get much of a reception. Some Wittgensteinian fideists, if that is what they are, are justly told off for “evasion and double-talk”. Kierkegaard is found simply baffling. Pascal appears largely as an advocate of intellectual dishonesty.
A book which is as admirable as this, in many and not merely intellectual ways, and which confines itself to working its way, with negative results, through these arguments, must raise the question of where these ways of going on now stand. Its approach, it seems to me, concedes at once too little and too much to religion. It concedes too much to these arguments in pretending that it is an open question whether they could deliver their conclusion. They may in their various ways have incidental logical and philosophical interest, as involving one or another fallacy or equivocation, but I wonder what unbeliever now could be swayed by them towards belief, or what believer, looking for intellectual reassurance, could find it in them? It is not so much that Hume and Kant, to whom Mackie with characteristic candour and clarity expresses his debts, broke up most of this furniture a long time ago, but rather that the world since then has drastically damaged the rooms in which it used to stand.
Someone who is drawn to religion now—here as least, and I do not speak of Teheran—will be drawn to it by needs which do not simply come before these arguments psychologically, as Mackie would concede, nor try to provide a new argument (which will, as Mackie insists, be a bad one), but which rather invoke a conception of what religion does which seems remote from the spirit of these arguments. It is here that Mackie’s approach seems to concede too little to religion: too little, that is to say, to the needs that it has served. He does indeed consider possible causes of religious belief, but, once more, in relation to an argument about truth. Is it an argument for the truth of religious belief that it exists at all? Of course it is not, since many causes of religious belief have been suggested, some of which could be adequate and not at all involve its truth. Feuerbach, Marx, Freud and others are thus appropriately mentioned, and to deal with the argument, that is enough.
But as soon as one sees religion, as Mackie rightly does, as a purely human phenomenon, it becomes a matter of great importance what human phenomenon it is, and which of these explanations, if any, is true. In particular, it is a crucial question whether the account of religion that one eventually has is one that represents its content—above all, its more unnerving and anti-humanist content—as something alien to humanity and its needs, now simply abandoned by advanced thought, or rather sees it as expressing needs that will have to be expressed in some form when the belief in God has disappeared.
It is because of these questions that the issues remain with philosophy. It might be said, and Mackie himself might have said it, that after the issues of truth and argument have been laid aside, there is no philosophy of religion, or at least no decent philosophy of religion, but only anthropology or another social science to help us, or perhaps the imaginative powers of literature. That may be right, so far as something called the philosophy of religion is concerned, but it is not the end of philosophy’s involvement with religion. For in moral philosophy at least, and in the reflections about society and about the mind that must be part of it, there must be some attitude involved towards the needs that religion has served, and some consequences to be drawn from the ways in which it has served them.
In one of his more Russellian moments, dealing with Kierkegaard, Mackie says, “We are, in effect, back with the god of the Book of Job, and whatever we may think of Job himself, there can be no doubt that Jehovah comes out of that story very badly.” But the author of the Book of Job knew that; or at any rate he knew something that raised the question for him very clearly. That religion can be, as Mackie points out, a nasty business, is a fact built into any religion worth worrying about, and that is one reason why it has seemed to so many people the only adequate response to the nasty business that everything is.
That does not make it true, and Mackie’s truthful, reasonable and humane book tells us that very clearly. At the end of its forceful and economical arguments, however, one faces a paradox which arises from its own destructive success. It is only if religion is true that the most interesting question about it is its truth. If it is false, the most interesting question about it is not the truth or even the reasonableness of what it claims to tell us about the cosmos, but the content of what it actually tells us about humanity.

Offensive Literature: Decensorship in Britain, 1960–1982, by John Sutherland
John Sutherland has produced ‘a calendar following a series of events (mostly trials) from 1960 to the present day’, which deals briefly and brightly with obscenity cases from Lady Chatterley’s Lover and Fanny Hill to The Romans in Britain.1 The aim is to investigate changes in public attitudes to ‘offensive literature’. It is a lively survey, but is not the useful history of that process which might be written.
First of all, as a calendar, it is inaccurate. I would not rely on it for the date of Christmas. It does not state correctly the grounds on which the conviction in the Oz trial was overturned (misdirection of the jury on the meaning of ‘obscenity’). It says on page 3, wrongly, that in the same case John Mortimer defended Richard Neville, and on page 122 that he did not. In one of the brief excursions into cinema, there is a very muddled account of the French treatment of pornographic films. Pasolini’s Salo was not assigned to the ‘P’ category and sent to the blue movie-houses like Deep Throat. It was dealt with by a special administrative decree, which confined its showing in Paris to two art houses—a restriction which was firmly enforced.
This slip actually shows a serious misunderstanding of French attitudes to pornography and its relations to culture. They came out well in a conversation that some of us on the Committee on Obscenity and Film Censorship2 had with a French official about the criteria for a film’s being pornographic. He found the question not serious: ‘Everyone knows what a pornographic film is. There are no characters or plot, there is nothing but sexual activity, and it is not made by anyone that one has heard of.’ But, we boringly insisted, what if these criteria diverged? What if a film of nothing but sex were made by, say, Fellini? Pause. ‘Personellement, je le trouverais incroyable qu’un film de Fellini soit présenté dans les salles pornographiques.’
Carelessness is not confined to the facts. The book is written in a weirdly slapdash style, and is full of phrases such as ‘bowdlerised limbo’ and ‘buttressing Albion’s floodgates’. Some sentences are very peculiar. A ‘custodial fear of cheap literature’ is said to have been ‘very active in the 19th century and can be traced back aboriginally, to obstructions on vulgate Bibles’ (a vulgate Bible is, in fact, a Bible in Latin). The reasoning, too, sometimes seems to have slipped past the turnstile of thought while Sutherland was out. ‘Pornography, of course, grows old very fast, which is why skin mags customarily carry no date of issue’ presumably should read ‘Pornography hardly grows old at all, which is why … ’
The ‘of course’ in that last sentence is revealing. The book displays an attitude which can, quite often, be seen as a sprightly independence, but which sometimes sinks into a manner which has become a standard and odious feature of the radio interview, a knowing condescension to whatever view is being interrogated, from the standpoint of some other, vaguely implied, view which would itself be patronised and ridiculed if it were being questioned. The journalistic sneer slides lightly over every opinion, leaving a desolating sense that they are all equally prejudiced, naive or self-serving. Judges, barristers, liberal critics, pornographers and poets are all put in what Sutherland presumably regards as their place, though it is not at all clear where those places are. It would be ungracious of me not to mention that one exception is the Report of the Committee on Obscenity, which is treated in a very friendly manner.
Here and there in the book Sutherland gives an idea of the story he might have told about the changes in spirit that have occurred between the Chatterley trial and the present day. That story would have to consider three notable transformations. Then, the issues seemed to be importantly about literature, and now they do not. Then, pornography was a good cause for liberals, and now it is at best a nuisance. Then, those who were much concerned about pornography were all conservatives, and now they include some radicals. Associated with all these changes is the decline in esteem of the Obscene Publications Act, which started the period as the saviour of Lady Chatterley, but now seems confused, unhelpful, and too dependent on a useless definition of ‘obscenity’.
The main reason why literature is no longer the issue is that the liberals’ cause is, for now, largely won. After the acquittal in 1976 of Inside Linda Lovelace, not itself a work of literature, the DPP [Director of Public Prosecutions] seems to have given up on works consisting only of the printed word, and our recommendation that such works should not be restricted at all on grounds of obscenity was, as Sutherland says, virtually a recognition of the existing state of affairs. But the Obscene Publications Act and the other confused provisions remain, and who knows whether the literary issues that Sutherland is able to chronicle as past may not come back again? If they do, it is very hard to believe that the ‘public good defence’ offered by Section 4 of the Act could any longer be seriously thought to provide a respectable way of resolving them.
On the question of nuisance, the obtrusive effect of publicly displayed pornography, the Indecent Displays (Control) Act has had some effect—much the same effect, so far as the outside of the premises is concerned, as we recommended. The effect in some places is certainly awful, and the blank fronts of closely ranged sex shops an urban blight. As Sutherland says, ‘row upon row of shuttered shops all containing wares of matching uniform ugliness, is not the urban renewal one would wish on central London.’ Without the shutters, however, they would also, as he puts it, fill him with a ‘Kurtzian exterminatory rage’. Here the only cure, short of a regeneration of society and the disappearance of the problem, seems to be measures to reduce the density of the shops, and I think that there is a good case for introducing planning powers, as we did not positively recommend, of the general kind that the GLC [Greater London Council] is taking, to lighten this environmental oppression.
In some other hearts, however, the Kurtzian exterminatory rage has turned against the whole business. The most striking recent phenomenon, one that Sutherland takes up in his last chapter, is the vocal (and sometimes physical) opposition to pornography expressed by the radical feminist movement: already established in the USA, it was not to be heard very distinctly in this country five years ago. Some of its materials are the same as those of more traditional protesters, and some are reworkings of old misconceptions: for instance, that all pornography is basically the same, making the same appeal to the same fantasies, and that those fantasies are very simply related to reality and to action.3
Other ideas are more distinctive, such as the assumption that if ‘soft-core’ pornography is very sexist (as it is), ‘hard-core’ pornography must be even more sexist. This is not true. While a lot of extreme pornography certainly expresses sadistic fantasies against women, the standard blue movie, too hard-core to collect a BBFC [ British Board of Film Censors] ‘18’ certificate, is usually less sexist, whatever else it may be, than the contents of Playboy or Mayfair or the unspeakable and endlessly popular Emmanuelle.
This is because the conventions that divide the soft from the hard precisely involve differences in the ways in which the sexes are represented, in who may be shown in a state of excitement, and so on. Blue movies may exploit everyone, but they do not markedly more exploit the women involved in them than the men. There is some truth, if only some, in the idea that mass-circulation soft-core pornography is sexist primarily because anything mass-circulated is sexist.
Have the ugly and assaulting fantasies presented by pornography any right to exist? Does anything need to be shown, beyond their content, in order to deny that right? The feminist Left standardly thinks not (‘pornography is violence against women’), and in this it resembles the militant Right. Neither party, interestingly, is first concerned with the question that preoccupies those who sit on government committees—and those who subsequently sit on the committees’ reports—namely, what should the law be? Conservative pressure-groups (but not Lord Longford) have often been reluctant to be tied down to any details for a replacement of the Obscene Publications Act, and radical feminism is at best uneasy, sometimes openly contemptuous, about the machinery of regulatory laws.
In this, the feminists are more consistent than the conservatives. The latter have the same interest as the rest of the bourgeois community in the processes of law, and in the application of administrative discriminations to an imperfect society. But radical feminism is professedly utopian, and not concerned with such temporising measures as the regulation of pornography. The aim is to eliminate these fantasies, and what they express, altogether. But whatever the cause of pornography and its aggressive fantasies is taken to be—capitalism, or the male principle itself (‘women do not have violent fantasies, only men do,’ a woman said to me in a public meeting, trembling with rage)—its elimination will need at least time and transformation, some regulation will be needed in the meantime, and we are left with the doubtless boring question of what it should be. In face of the radical feminists, I am left also with a less wearily gradualist thought. Pornography may well be internationally a substantial criminal industry, and that fact in itself demands attention. But from the point of view of cultural criticism, when one is confronted with what is still the pervasive, lying and destructive sexism of almost all our popular culture, to go on about the particular nuisance of pornography is largely a diversion to a more traditional and much less significant target.

Consequences of Pragmatism (Essays 1972–1980), by Richard Rorty
Richard Rorty’s recent book Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature is an original and sustained attack on the idea that it can be the aim of philosophy, or even of science, to represent the world accurately. Neither activity can reveal, as he sometimes puts it, a vocabulary in which the world demands to be described. The book is remarkable for its learning and for its powers of critical exposition. At the same time, some of it is slapdash, and its program for what philosophy should do when robbed of its traditional conceptions of truth and objectivity is, to put it mildly, schematic.
The present volume consists of twelve already published essays written between 1972 and 1980, together with a new introduction.1 The jacket says that it fills in the details of the story told in Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature, but it actually does something more interesting than that. It reveals Rorty’s attitude toward questions bearing on the central theories of the earlier book, and offers his view of other philosophers and traditions, including Heidegger, about whom he says that he would now want to revise his view upward. The essays here also have a hero, who was less explicitly seen as one in The Mirror of Nature. This is John Dewey; and the pragmatism of the title is above all that of Dewey.
Rorty claims to free Dewey from dated associations, and to find him already waiting at the end of a road on which Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida are now traveling. Dewey’s “chief enemy,” Rorty writes, “was the notion of Truth as accuracy of representation, the notion later to be attacked by Heidegger, Sartre, Foucault. Dewey thought that if he could break down this notion, … we would be receptive to notions like Derrida’s—that language is not a device for representing reality but a reality in which we live and move.”
The new book shares some failings with The Mirror of Nature, and at the end we still do not know much about how philosophy should go on without its old illusions. Rorty’s style also provides some minor irritations, such as his tendency to parade lists of great names and of turning points in the history of philosophy (something that could be a legacy from his early days at the University of Chicago). But the essays are wide-ranging, informed, and above all interesting. Rorty has an unsettling vision of philosophy, science, and culture, and it matters to what extent he is right. Like others who have a large view, he sometimes seems to the analytical critic to have run different questions together. What is not always true in such cases, but is usually true of Rorty, is that when he has run different questions together each of them turns out to have its own interest.
“It is impossible to step outside our skins—the traditions, linguistic and other, within which we do our thinking and self-criticism—and compare ourselves with something absolute.” That is one of Rorty’s central theses. Or, rather, it is several theses. The least contentious is that we cannot think about the world without describing it in some way: the world cannot present itself uncategorized. Moreover, there is no way in which the world simply describes itself, or presents itself in terms that could not themselves be the subject of inquiry, reflection, and alternative proposals. Those claims, in themselves, are not too upsetting. They still allow us to think that there is an independent world that we are trying to describe, and that what it is actually like can control the success of our descriptions.
Rorty’s pragmatist, however, reaches much more drastic conclusions than this, and claims (so it seems) that all we can ever do is compare one description with another. He denies that “deep down beneath all the texts, there is something which is not just one more text but that to which various texts are trying to be ‘adequate.’ ” He does not think that we can say anything substantial about the purposes served by our descriptions, against which we might test them. Moreover, in addition to this, Rorty has a further, historicist thesis, according to which the categories that any human group uses are a function of its time, and are essentially formed through historically localized tradition. The historicist thesis plays a large part both in The Mirror of Nature and in the present essays.
If one says that any human thought is inescapably immersed in the traditions of its period, what counts as “a period” is an important question; and, in particular, what tradition performs this basic function for us. Rorty is not very definite about this. In The Mirror of Nature sometimes it is the period of “Western man” or “modern Western man.” In the present book the relevant item, at least once, is “human thought since 1600.” The question particularly presses, because Rorty is so insistent that we cannot, in philosophy, simply be talking about human beings, as opposed to human beings at a given time. In the course of a perceptive discussion of Thomas Nagel and Stanley Cavell, both philosophers who (in different terms) hope to recover from the tradition deep philosophical questions that relate to human experience as such, Rorty precisely contrasts the approach of taking some philosophical problem and asking, as they might, “What does it show us about being human?” and asking, on the other hand, “What does the persistence of such problems show us about being twentieth-century Europeans?” (his emphases).
The historicist ideas do provide one fairly natural way of interpreting Rorty’s main thesis, but they do not merely follow from it, even in its most radical form. Basically, he accepts the historicist outlook because he believes that the history of philosophy has itself led us to it. He thinks that Dewey, Quine, Wittgenstein, Heidegger, and Derrida are the true descendants in their various styles of Hegel and the nineteenth-century philosophers who reacted against the Kantian claim that philosophy could discover “the a priori structure of any possible inquiry….” As he interprets them, they have led us to see that there is not much more to be said about the ways in which we describe the world than that they are the ways that suit us, now. Of course philosophy, traditionally, has tried to say more than that. It has tried to overcome what it has seen as deep and persistent problems about the relation of our thought and action to the world. For Rorty these writers have, accordingly, led us to a point at which traditional philosophy should end.
Sometimes Rorty takes a slightly different turn in his insistence on historical self-consciousness and in his rejection of general groundings for his or any other method. That we should see philosophy and other intellectual activities in the way he commends is not a lesson of where we have come to in history—something that we should rationally conclude from it—but simply a product of that history. We are where we now are, and that is how we, now, go on.
Rorty is not a relativist. He has as crisp a view as any positivist in agreeing, for instance, that it was a good thing that the world that was based on religious conceptions and authority has passed, and he cheerfully describes a certain attitude as “merely a relic of pre-Galilean anthropomorphism.” But is he really in a position to dismiss relativism and the problems associated with it, as he does in one essay? The sort of dialectic in which Rorty’s self-conscious historicism places him is one in which everyone can try to undercut everyone else by asking others whether they have allowed for the ways by which their own consciousness has evolved the very thesis they are advancing. Self-consciousness and reflective awareness, when made into the distinctive attitude of a sophisticated philosophy, make it revolve ever faster; the owl of Minerva, robbed by later skepticism of Hegel’s flight plan to the transcendental standpoint, notoriously finds itself flying in ever-decreasing circles.
Rorty’s procedures, in these respects, are an odd mixture. Sometimes he seems quite knowing about the status of his own thoughts (though he is not as quick on the turn as the French writers, such as Derrida, whom he most admires, or as the poststructuralist critics are, who need these reflexes to keep alive). At other times, he seems to forget altogether about one requirement of self-consciousness, and like the old philosophies he is attempting to escape, naively treats his own discourse as standing quite outside the general philosophical situation he is describing. He thus neglects the question whether one could accept his account of various intellectual activities, and still continue to practice them.
Some of the nastier problems of this sort arise with his treatment of the natural and biological sciences. Rorty’s characteristic tone about science is that there is nothing in the least special or particularly interesting about it.
Pragmatism … does not erect Science as an idol to fill the place once held by God. It views science as one genre of literature—or, put the other way around, literature and the arts as inquiries on the same footing as scientific inquiries…. Physics is a way of trying to cope with various bits of the universe; ethics is a matter of trying to cope with other bits.
In a similar vein he says, in an article called “Method, Social Science, and Social Hope,” that it simply turned out that the Galilean picture of the universe worked better than, say, an Aristotelian picture, but that there is no “epistemological moral” to be drawn from this. In particular, he argues, it is a confusion to think that the success of physics since Galileo is somehow connected with the fact that it regards the universe as “infinite and cold and comfortless,” and it is a mistake to look for any scientific method that explains scientific success. Indeed, the question “What makes science so successful?” is for him a bad question. He applauds T. S. Kuhn’s notion of Galilean science “as exemplifying the power of new vocabularies rather than offering the secret of scientific success.”
In the essay just referred to, and to a lesser degree in The Mirror of Nature, Rorty runs together two questions. One is whether the success of science invites or permits any interesting description of what the success of science consists of. The other question is whether, from its previous success, we can derive any general methods to secure its future success. The questions are distinct. Karl Popper, for instance, who, like Rorty, thinks that there is not much to be said about the second question beyond banal recipes of rational procedure, also believes, unlike Rorty, that there is something to be said about the objective progress of science in finding out what the world is really like.
It is harder than Rorty supposes to throw away conceptions of the aim of science such as Popper’s, and it is harder in more than one way. It is harder, first of all, because it is not clear what Rorty wants us to put in their place. Science “copes,” “is successful,” its vocabularies have “power”; but they have power or success in doing what? In generating predictions, Rorty is sometimes rash enough to say, and that means better predictions. Here we find we are being taken on an old-fashioned philosophical ride. Doesn’t “better” mean, for instance, “true”? On Rorty’s view there is no point in getting off at that stop: “Truth is simply a compliment paid to sentences seen to be paying their way.” But what is it that we see when we see that they are paying their way?
This is a very old subject of debate, and it is still going on in orthodox analytical philosophy. Rorty’s pragmatist does not want to win that debate or to continue it, but rather to opt out of the whole thing, to change the subject. Some analytical philosophers will say that he can’t do that. But Rorty is surely right in saying that much philosophical achievement has consisted simply in changing the subject, and if the pragmatist changes this subject, he changes it.
To me the weakness of Rorty’s position lies in something else, that he sees all this as a matter simply for philosophy; he sees changing the subject as making a move within, or out of, philosophy. This seriously neglects the extent to which the descriptions that he dislikes come from within science itself. Science itself moves the boundaries of explanation and of what is explained, just as it moves the boundary of what counts as observation. It was always a mistake for philosophers to contrast in any absolute way the “observable” and the “theoretical” in science, since theory creates and constitutes new forms of observation. Scientific theory explains, moreover, how such an elaborately constructed image as an electron micrograph can be the record of an observation.
The sharp distinction between theory and observation was a mistake made by Rorty’s enemies, the positivists, who celebrated science for its respect for brute fact. But such criticisms of the positivists turn against Rorty himself, because they are an example of something which, it seems, he should regard as impossible, namely of science explaining the reliability of its own observations. Similarly science can often explain the truth of its conjectures. Advances in scientific theory quite often, in fact, involve explaining why some predictions of previous theories were true, while others failed. Not all scientific advance does that—no recipe fits all scientific advance—but it is one important phenomenon that gives substance to the idea of objective scientific advance.
More generally, it is an important feature of modern science, not mentioned by Rorty, that it makes some contribution to explaining how science itself is possible, and how creatures that have the origins and characteristics it says we have can understand a world that has the properties it says the world has. To say that such achievements as evolutionary biology and the findings of the neurological sciences, for example, are trivial, and that any old theory could do what they do, is simply a mistake (though it is true that limitless numbers of theories could deal with the same questions trivially). These ideas contribute, from within scientific reflection itself, to an image of the objects of science which Rorty says we should not have; they contribute, that is, to a conception of the world as it is, independently of our inquiries. That conception may be an illusion, but if it is, it is not the product of a simple philosophical error to be explained in a line or two of reference to Kant and his successors; and, above all, it is not simply a product of philosophy.
Correspondingly, it is not just a question of philosophy whether it is hard to give up that conception of the world. The other sense in which it will prove hard to give up is one in which it will be hard to give it up even if it is an illusion. It will be hard to give up for those working in science.
There is an important contrast here, which Rorty seems not to see, between scientific inquiry on the one hand and Rorty’s interesting ideas about the future of philosophy. In a revealing passage he says that “pragmatism denies the possibility of getting beyond the … notion of ‘seeing how things hang together’—which, for the bookish intellectual of recent times, means seeing how all the various vocabularies of all the various epochs and cultures hang together.” That may be a program for the successor of philosophy, or for the literary studies from which he does not want that successor to be distinct, but it is certainly no program for science. The sense that one is not locked in a world of books, that one is confronting “the world,” that the work is made hard or easy by what is actually there—these are part of the driving force, the essential consciousness of science; and even if Rorty’s descriptions of what science really is are true, they are not going to be accepted into that consciousness without altering it in important ways—almost certainly for the worse, so far as the progress of science is concerned.
But if that is so, then a dreadful problem confronts the pragmatist: whether his ideas can be, in their own terms, “true” at all. For the pragmatist to say that his formulations are true presumably means simply that they work out: and what reasons have we to think that the pragmatists’ sentences about science will work out better in the practice of scientists than scientists’ sentences do? The point here is not that scientists have self-revealing knowledge of what they are up to, but merely that the scientists’ sentences help to keep them going—and that, for the pragmatist, is all that can matter.
Indeed, there is a question whether the pragmatist can even appropriately say many of the things that Rorty says. Here there is a problem that was seen more clearly by Wittgenstein than by any of the other philosophers whom Rorty admires, certainly more clearly than by Rorty himself. If it is impossible to provide grounds for, or get beyond, what, at a very general level, we naturally say; and if philosophy, as traditionally understood, tried to go beyond that, and so should now end; why should it not simply end, so that all we should say is what anyway we naturally say? In The Mirror of Nature there are passages to the effect that we have merely found it overwhelmingly “convenient” to say that physics describes a world which is already there, rather than, for instance, that the world changes in relation to our descriptions. But if that is overwhelmingly convenient, and the only consideration can be what is convenient, then what everyone should be saying is simply: physics describes a world that is already there. So why does Rorty go on telling us not to say that?
Here the Rortian pragmatist, like the follower of Wittgenstein, is likely to say something to the effect that without the startling reminders he provides one may be misled, and succumb to false images of our situation. Misled by what? The answer often is—by philosophy, or by similarly irresponsible kinds of discourse. Wittgenstein often gives this answer (though he also gives the materials for some better ones): it is what underlies his famous remark that philosophy occurs “when language goes on holiday,” a remark which, one might say, is, like some others of his, deeply shallow. In fact, the “misleading” impressions are encouraged not just by philosophy but by such activities as pursuing physics. So unless science itself is revealed as an unnatural or holiday activity, it is part of our nature, and not simply a product of philosophy, that we should be “misled.”
But then there is a real problem of what content is left, on the pragmatist’s assumptions, to saying that we are misled at all, and of what basis he can have for saying it, unless he tries to reoccupy the kind of transcendental standpoint, outside human speech and activity, that is precisely what he wants us to renounce.
There is, then, more than one question about how to read Rorty’s descriptions of scientific activity, if we accept his view of what such descriptions can be. There is a different set of problems about the self-understanding, and the future, of philosophy. The problems are different, in particular, because Rorty expects science to continue—its “discoveries form the basis of modern scientific civilization. We can hardly be too grateful for them.” But philosophy should come to an end; or rather, as he often puts it, “Philosophy” should, where the upper case stands for philosophy as a distinct Fach or professional undertaking. There will be room for a kind of post-Philosophical philosophy, a kind of cultural criticism, for which there is no very special expertise. Occasionally Rorty’s speculations about the future of this activity strike a Marxian-utopian note; the nonprofessional inheritor of Philosophy will be a new Renaissance polymath doing literary criticism in the morning and history in the afternoon, and doing them in a spirit of Nietzschean gaiety.
Yet here again there is a problem about how this activity is supposed to coexist with a consciousness of its own nature. It is hard to see how these new forms of intellectual life can thrive for long, when they are at the same time so professedly second-order, derivative, and parasitic on the activities of those in the past who have taken themselves to be doing Philosophy in its own right. “Philosophers could be seen as people who work with the history of philosophy and the contemporary effects of those ideas called ‘philosophic’ upon the rest of culture….” The reference to the history of philosophy, and the quotes around “philosophic,” immediately reveal the inherited identity that backs up this image. Even the Nietzschean gaiety relates to the use of these figures of the past; it is with approval, I think, that he says of Derrida (one of those who recognize where we really are) that he “does not want to comprehend Hegel’s book; he wants to play with Hegel.”
I doubt, in fact, whether Rorty has extracted from the ruins, as he sees it, of Philosophy any activity that will sustain a post-Philosophical culture of the kind that he sketches. It is not very realistic to suppose that we could for long sustain much of a culture, or indeed keep away boredom, by playfully abusing the texts of writers who believed in an activity which we now know to be hopeless.
Rorty’s views, however, affect more than the future of philosophy considered as a distinct activity. They raise important questions about the significance for culture in general of certain intellectual ideals—above all, a certain image of truthfulness—which philosophy, in some of its styles, particularly cultivates.
One of Rorty’s aims is to overcome the division between scientific and literary culture; he refers surprisingly often to the late Lord Snow, associating with him various distinctions that are considerably subtler than any that occurred to Snow himself. At the same time, he wants to overcome the divide between two kinds of contemporary philosophy, broadly called “analytical” and “Continental.” I have already said that so far as the future of culture is concerned, the first of these aims is not going to be realized in Rorty’s terms, since the business of engaging in scientific research, and the intellectual motivations that people have for doing so, are so totally unlike making comparisons within a web of texts that even if (in some sense that Rorty still needs to explain) that is what science really is, the activity will, so long as it flourishes, reject that description of itself.
But that was a point about describing the aims of science, not of adopting a specific methodology, and even if science successfully continues with the conception of itself as discovering what is really there—if, that is to say, science continues—this leaves open most questions about its connections with any wider cultural or social conceptions of rationality. Here the other divide, between the two kinds of philosophy, comes into the picture. There is something in what Rorty says when he claims that analytical philosophy and Continental philosophy have been the public-relations agencies of science and of literature respectively.
There is something in it, though much is left out. Positivism apart, analytical philosophy has not been committed to the supremacy of science, or to validating science’s laudatory images of itself, and all of this Rorty himself explains very well, both here and in The Mirror of Nature. (He says, incidentally, in the preface to that book, that it could as well have been written in a Heideggerian as in an analytical style, and it is simply a matter of his own experience that he has chosen the latter. He may believe this claim, but I doubt that anyone else does.) But it is certainly true that the discourse of analytical philosophy, its argumentative procedures, are more continuous with those of scientists. It seems to its practitioners more responsible, more consequential, less open to arbitrariness, whimsicality, and rhetoric than other styles of philosophy, and I suspect that it seems so to scientists as well, insofar as it does not seem to them, along with most other philosophy, merely pointless.
If Rorty is right, there is nothing to these contrasts at all, and analytical philosophy’s claim to greater intellectual virtue, of a kind that has some general cultural significance, is simply baseless. It merely mistakes articulateness for clarity of perception and argumentativeness for rationality. It derives no prestige from its relation to science, both because there is no methodology that it can share with science, and because science isn’t in any case what this philosophy generally thinks science is. Its characteristic neglect of the imagination is not a contribution to objectivity but a self-inflicted limitation. If analytic philosophy is like anything else at all, it most resembles the activities of lawyers under an adversarial system, and its admired skills are mainly the forensic skills of courtroom debate.
“Forensic” might be thought at least minimally a compliment, but the complimentary element is missing. Granted a legal system, forensic practices can be thought to assist justice. But without any analogous system of rules, without any accepted standards of argument and evidence, the forensic practices of philosophy will be left, for Rorty, only with the worst aspects of the adversarial system. Thus analytical philosophy is not more rationally organized than any other sort of philosophy; it merely employs a different kind of rhetoric, and uses different methods to bully opponents.
Rorty has made a vigorous and entirely serious challenge, which raises a question more important than merely how to do philosophy. That question can never in the end be that important, and Rorty himself criticizes some philosophers he admires, such as Heidegger, for overrating the significance of philosophy itself for civilization. But the value of philosophical styles of argument goes beyond the value of philosophy, because of the virtues that they try to express. No one has to believe that the questions of philosophy are the most important questions there are, or that philosophy can discover what mankind should be doing. But analytical philosophy does hold that it offers a very abstract example of certain virtues of civilized thought: because it gives reasons and sets out arguments in a way that can be explicitly followed and considered; and because it makes questions clearer and sorts out what is muddled.
On this view, analytical philosophy asserts important freedoms, both to pursue the argument and, in its more imaginative reaches, to develop alternative pictures of the world and of human life. It is both a creative activity and an activity pursued under constraints—constraints experienced as, among others, those of rational consistency. Its experience of those constraints, and the terms in which it approves those who most imaginatively work within them, is one where its spirit overlaps with the sciences. Both in this philosophy and in the sciences, the ideal is the old Socratic ideal that mere rhetoric and the power of words will not prevail.
This is the image of philosophy and its virtues that Rorty radically criticizes. He seems to me, however, very unradical and excessively optimistic in his picture of an intellectual community that has got rid of this image. Certain “conversational constraints” (of roughly Habermas’s kind: he does not say much about them) will keep things together as much as anything ever does, and we shall just have to do whatever we can to sustain traditions of open-mindedness and receptiveness to new considerations. He does not want us to get too excited or unnerved by, for instance, Foucault’s vision of discourse as a network of power relations. “ ‘Power’ and ‘culture,’ ” he writes, “are equipollent indications of the social forces which make us more than animals—and which, when the bad guys take over, can turn us into something worse and more miserable than animals.” When the bad guys take over: there are at least four different ways of intelligibly stressing the words in that phrase, and each of them expresses an equally shallow way of thinking about what happens to a society when rational civility collapses.
No more than in The Mirror of Nature does Rorty give many indications of how discourse should go on when freed of the illusions of truth and objectivity. In the general cultural context, he is just as optimistically neglectful as he was in the case of science about the effects of everyone’s coming to believe what he has to say—effects which the pragmatist, least of all, can afford to neglect. But that still does not mean that he is wrong, except possibly by his own standards of what it is to be wrong, and his challenge to the standards of what analytical philosophy calls clarity and rationality remains one to be taken seriously.
His kind of questioning has great force in a field that he himself does not take up, that of moral philosophy. Analytical moral philosophy has now revived the activity of theorizing about what is right and wrong rather than merely analyzing ethical terms. What this activity urgently requires, and has never yet managed to provide, is some coherent understanding of the relations of such theory to practice, where this includes the relations of the theorists to the rest of society. In the work of such philosophers as Peter Singer, it seems merely to be assumed that the virtues of an intellectual theory, such as economy and simplicity, translate into a desirable rationality of social practice. That represents a Platonic rationalism of the most suspect kind. There is no advance guarantee of ways in which humane and just social practices may relate to philosophical theory of any sort. That is just one application of the question that Rorty rightly presses, of the relations between the discursive virtues of analytical philosophy on the one hand, and desirable forms of social rationality on the other.
These essays along with The Mirror of Nature should encourage philosophers, and not only philosophers, to ask and pursue that question. There are lessons to be learned from the new and unexpected forms in which Rorty puts the question. There is also something to be learned from the weak parts of his account. The two major weak points are the inadequacy (certainly the pragmatic inadequacy) of his account of science, and the very weak indications that he gives of the nature of a post-Philosophical culture. Perhaps this double weakness expresses a strength in the traditional idea that philosophy and science can share a conception of truthfulness that is not merely an application of the will to power.
An account of the relation of science to culture should still start, it seems to me, from that impression which so powerfully affects its practitioners, and which is so dismissively treated by Rorty: that science offers one of the most effective ways in which we can be led out of the web of texts, the archive of discourse in which Rorty finds himself imprisoned along with the “bookish intellectuals of recent times.” In his optimistic dealings with Foucault, Rorty quotes the dreadful sentence “Man is in the process of perishing as the being of language continues to shine ever brighter upon our horizon.” I suspect that unless we keep the sense (cherished but misinterpreted by empiricism) that science finds ways out of the cell of words, and if we do not recover the sense that pursuing science is one of our essential experiences of being constrained by the truth, we shall find that the brightness of language on the horizon turns out to be that of the fire in which the supremely bookish hero of Canetti’s Auto-Da-Fé immolated himself in his library.

1. Consequences of Pragmatism (Essays 1972–1980), by Richard Rorty (University of Minnesota Press, 1982).
The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell, vol. I, Cambridge Essays 1888–99, edited by Kenneth Blackwell and others
This is the first volume of a projected series of all Bertrand Russell’s papers, published and unpublished, to be issued in 28 volumes between now and the year 2000.1 The volumes will be divided into two major groups by subject, so that volumes II to XI will consist of strictly philosophical material, while volumes XII to XXVI, containing political and social papers, will be ordered chronologically. A paper, for these purposes, is a ‘public writing,’ including political messages and open letters as well as newspaper articles, book reviews and essays. 90 per cent of these papers, the editors claim, have never been collected, and 15 per cent are unpublished.
This vast enterprise is edited from the Russell Archive at McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, an institution whose quiet existence on a scarp by the Niagara River was transformed when it became, through the purchase in 1968 of Russell’s papers, the world centre of Russell studies. The editors have provided a full-scale apparatus, with elaborate annotations and textual notes. This is clearly intended to be a great monument.
The first volume covers, among other things, Russell’s adolescent years, undergraduate work at Cambridge, and material associated with his first and second books: ‘German Social Democracy’ (1896) and ‘An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry’ (1897). A good deal of the material is unpublished. Some papers that Russell read to the Apostles, that now excessively well-known secret society, are included, to some extent marked by what Paul Levy, in his biography of Moore, unkindly called the ‘sophomoric’ quality of the discussions. Russell, urging the cause of the admission of women (not entirely popular with his brethren), observes: ‘… when we divided last term on “Can we love those we copulate with?” the presence of women in the discussion would have been invaluable.’
From his years as an undergraduate, there is a ‘locked diary’ (‘the dons are sad specimens of wasted power, and have persuaded me that emoluments for mere academical distinction are a very pernicious institution’), and there are also some essays read to his philosophy teachers which, perhaps unsurprisingly, are greatly impressive. His history of philosophy is more accurate than in ‘The History of Western Philosophy,’ but there are fewer jokes.
The overwhelming impression is not merely the fact of Russell’s precocity, but how much of his later style and manner was already formed in these earliest years. In 1888–9, when he was 16, he kept a secret journal written in Greek letters. It is full of sentences such as ‘I now come to the most difficult of subjects, immortality, a question I have already tried to answer in this book, but, as now seems to me, on false lines of reasoning….’ He seems to have had from the beginning an extraordinarily easy and elegant way of writing, and some of the earliest pieces here are a great pleasure to read, while one is less irritated at this stage of his life than one is in his later writing by those less happy characteristics of the bright youth which he was never to lose—the occasional condescension, for instance, and the unnerving briskness. He said that by the time he came to write anything down, almost all the work had already been done; but the impression he too often gives in his mature work is rather that the work is being done then, at the speed it takes to read it.
After he left Cambridge, his wit also found its natural shape, and there are some funny pieces in the book, particularly an unpublished item on the Uses of Luxury. The introduction to this, incidentally, shakes one’s confidence in the editors, who seem to be better detectives than readers. They have tirelessly uncovered possible locations at which the paper may have been read, but they also say that it defends inherited income, which it expressly attacks.
This very interesting book contains, as all this series will, public and scholarly documents rather than personal ones. We do not have so much here as we do in the ‘Autobiography’ of Russell’s chilly declarations of his emotions, but rather discover him looking brightly and busily outwards, at intellectual and political problems. It is rather wonderful to see him so fully formed so early, exercising just the weapons he would use for the next 80 years.

Reasons and Persons, by Derek Parfit
Ten or fifteen years ago, the complaint against moral philosophy was that it did not address practical problems, but concentrated on meta-ethics: that is to say, on questions about the status, meaning, objectivity and so forth of ethical thought. That complaint is now out of date. For a decade, analytical philosophy has been conspicuously concerned to display its credentials for being of use in helping us to think about concrete problems.
In doing that, it has escaped the charge of evasiveness, but has slipped back into the line of fire of other accusations. One is that it has disconnected itself from other speculative, critical or, indeed, philosophical thought. Philosophers have tended to turn to ethical theory, an enterprise that tries to resolve practical dilemmas by appealing to a structure of moral principles, a systematic framework which philosophical ingenuity can hope to apply to concrete issues. This raises the question why a set of ideas should be thought to have any special authority over our sentiments and our lives because it has the structure of a theory. Besides having this very basic problem of what might be called theoretical authority, ethical theory has sometimes been impoverished because it has cultivated too much the autonomy of ethics, and neglected other areas of philosophy, and (with the exception of some philosophers such as John Rawls) other disciplines.
Derek Parfit has written a brilliantly clever and imaginative book which treats in a very original way a wide range of ethical questions.1 It spends virtually no time on meta-ethics (perhaps too little), but it avoids many of the deformations that sometimes afflict first-order ethical philosophy. It makes contact with other subjects, such as welfare economics. It is deeply involved with some other parts of philosophy, in particular with questions of personal identity and of what a person is. It also starts the subject, rightly, not within the sphere of morality but in the wider area of practical reason, setting out from the question ‘what have we most reason to do?’ rather than from any distinctively ‘moral’ question.
Within ethical thought, Parfit does not start off with any ethical system. Nor does he hope to conjure one out of nothing at all. He concentrates on questions of consistency, asking us, over and over again, in different connections, what is implied by our ethical judgments, and whether what is implied hangs together with other implications to which, equally, we seem to be committed. That is not his only method. He uses many methods of ethical argument, more than moral philosophers often acknowledge. It is only when in his concluding chapter he quietly displays a few of them, that one realises how naturally they have been deployed. In these ways he goes some way to meet the problem of theoretical authority—though not, I believe, far enough.
In starting with practical reason, and in some of his methods of argument, Parfit agrees with the Victorian moral philosopher Sidgwick, whom he greatly admires. Keynes thought that Sidgwick lacked intensity and was suffocated by respectability. Parfit would deny these charges against Sidgwick, but whether he is right in that or not, the charges certainly do not apply to this strange and excitingly intense book. It is in four parts. In the first, Parfit considers what it is for a theory of rational action to be, in any of various ways, self-defeating. He deals, very subtly, with such problems as this: if one believes that one’s aim should be to produce the best outcomes all round, it is very unlikely that the best way to do this is to consider, on each occasion, how one can bring about the best outcome. The best outcomes are more likely to be produced if each person acts from motives which do not involve thinking directly about the outcome. This has been thought to be a problem for consequentialist theories of this kind. Parfit insists that it is not, and that this result does nothing to refute the theory that we should produce the best outcomes all round. It merely tells us how to produce them, by cultivating in ourselves other dispositions. In other cases, however, theories can be damagingly self-defeating, by enjoining on each of us courses of action which, when we all pursue them, collectively defeat the objectives at which the theory was aiming in the first place (which is not so, Parfit claims, with the innocuously self-defeating consequentialist theories).
In these connections, Parfit has a lot to say about problems that have concerned decision theorists, such as the famous Prisoner’s Dilemma, which makes it distressingly clear how courses of action that are individually rational can be jointly damaging, and also that when the parties know that fact, they may still have good reason to follow them. These issues, and many others of the same kind which he discusses, have a good deal to do with politics. Parfit makes it clear that they do, but he does not for the most part discuss them as though they did. The discussion is detailed, quite hard, and very revealing, but in social or political terms it is rather airless. He does not consider what institutions would be needed, for instance, or what forms of social understanding, in order to do what he, like Sidgwick, recommends us to do, which is to induce in ourselves dispositions of action which serve the ends of an underlying ethical theory while not revealing its content.
It is perhaps a pity that this rather daunting section has to come before the winningly ingenious discussion of rationality and time that forms the second part. In this Parfit asks whether we should be more concerned with what will happen tomorrow than with what will happen years from now, and if so, why. That is only the most familiar of such questions. He also wants to ask, for instance, why we should be more concerned with what will (or rather, may still) happen than we are with what has happened. Why is it good news that the nasty operation has already happened? If one is disposed to think that this issue, at least, is perfectly obvious, Parfit, with a very light touch, can turn one round to see that it is not.
In this section, too, he makes some important moves in a campaign which runs throughout the book and helps to unify it—the war against the Self-Interest Theory, which holds that the rational thing to do is to be concerned with one’s own aims and interests as viewed, so far as possible, over one’s whole life. This war Parfit conducts on two fronts, as he puts it. On one side, the theory is harassed by Morality, which says that we should be concerned with more than ourselves—for instance, with everybody. On the near side, it is undercut by the Present Aim Theory, which says that what it is rational for one to do now is what one wants now. For this view of things, or rather for a slightly more respectable version of it, Parfit makes a very good case against the Self-Interest Theory. One of his main objectives is to show that prudence does not have the special priority in rational behaviour that is often given to it. This is a good objective, but feckless readers who hoped to be liberated by it will find their enthusiasm dampened when they learn later that there is something wrong with imprudence after all: it is not irrational but immoral.
The reason for this is that our later selves are properly to be seen as rather like other people. Parfit is trying to get us to see that in practical reasoning ‘when?’ is much the same sort of question as ‘who?’ We should get rid of the picture that dominates us, or most of us, that there is some special identity that one has, some underlying item which is really me. We should get rid of the very compelling idea that there must always be a fully determinate answer to such questions as: ‘Will that person who will be in pain in ten years’ time be me or not?’ On the true view of things, according to Parfit, there may be simply no answer to that question. We should realise that, as Hume believed, a person is no more than a collection of experiences held together by certain relations, such as those of memory and continuity of character. When we see that, we shall understand that it is misguided to draw a sharp ethical or prudential line between ourselves and others.
These are the subjects of the third part of the book. In the final part, Parfit turns to problems raised by our concern for future generations, in particular by population policy and the question of how many people there should desirably be. As with personal identity, he has already published articles on this subject, and has made notable contributions to it—for instance, in discovering what he calls the Identity Problem. This lies in the fact that when we discuss whether future people will be better-off or not as a result of our policies, we cannot suppose that the same people will be there to be affected by one or another of our policies, since our actions will radically affect what individual people will come to exist. Parfit shows how arguments that may seem plausible in this area can lead to undesirable results, such as the Repugnant Conclusion, as he calls it, according to which an indefinitely large population of people whose lives were just worth living would be morally preferable to a smaller population of people who were a lot better-off. Parfit tries to find a theory that will avoid this result and at the same time certain other paradoxes. In the end, despite much ingenuity and refinement of argument, he confesses failure: but he can claim credit for identifying some remarkable problems along the way, which will undoubtedly generate discussion for a long time to come.
The intensity displayed by the book is in good part argumentative. Short, sharply-defined sentences are loosed at one in compact formations; the effect, at times, is of one who will not let you go. But there is an imaginative intensity as well, displayed above all in the examples, often simple, carefully designed, each presented with a title—a device that could have been arch if used with less skill. Many of these examples are fanciful, particularly in the personal identity section, where teletransportation, bodily fission and other fantasies are introduced to construct cases that challenge our everyday assurance that we know what would and what would not count as the same person. Such fanciful cases have often been used by the philosophers who over the past decades have helped to set the agenda of Parfit’s discussion. Others reject them, saying that our concepts have developed to deal with the actual, not with worlds extensively different from ours, and there is no reason to expect those concepts to be able to breathe that alien atmosphere. To this line, Parfit has several sophisticated replies. One is that this idea could explain why in certain unlikely cases we might not know what to say, but it can hardly explain why, with other equally unlikely cases, we do seem to know what we would say. In some matters, again, and personal identity is one of them, the whole idea of not being able to give an answer is something that our common notions seem to exclude, and is a basic part of the problem.
They are good replies, it seems to me, when these are regarded simply as metaphysical issues. But it is less clear why they are adequate when we are concerned, as Parfit is, with supposed ethical consequences of metaphysical positions. To put it another way, it is not always clear why metaphysical positions, arrived at in this way, have ethical consequences at all. Parfit is encouraged by his metaphysics of the merely agglomerated self to accept an ethical outlook which abstracts from self-interest and sees other people, and stages of oneself, as more like one another than we normally suppose. He thinks that philosophy should move us to a more impersonal outlook. But the extent to which it should do that must surely depend on what the world is actually like. If the experiences which constitute one person are powerfully related to one another, and give their owner (as Parfit, rather riskily, allows us to call that person) a strong sense of his or her own identity and of difference from others, why should a metaphysical belief, that he or she is really a fuzzy set of experiences, provide a reason for feeling and acting in some altered way?
Connections between metaphysical and ethical issues are central to this work, but it is not always made clear how they run. In at least one case, one which Parfit touches only very briefly, they do not run at all. He says that if, as some metaphysicians have claimed, the passage of time is an illusion, it cannot be irrational in practical thought to have no preference for one time over another, such as a preference for the near over the far. But this does not follow. If time’s passage is an illusion, so is the flow of time apparently involved in action and deliberation themselves; relative to the metaphysical truth of the matter, the whole enterprise of practical deliberation, and all the various principles that might be brought to it, would alike have to be bracketed. If time’s passage is an illusion, we live that illusion, and finding out that it was an illusion would not provide us with a reason for deliberating in one way rather than another within it.
Parfit can convert the metaphysical into the practical so easily, I suspect, because the view that he takes of the practical, and of experience in general, is throughout the book so radically external. Philosophically speaking—it is not true of his literary allusions—he sees everything from the outside. In dealing with personal identity, this conceals from him one of the main reasons why people think that it must be a determinate question whether some future experience will be theirs or not: that if it will be theirs, they can, as well as expecting that it will happen, also expect it, in the sense of imaginatively anticipating having it; and there seems to be no room for the idea that it is simply indeterminate whether I can appropriately do that or not. If Parfit had discussed that particular point, it would not necessarily have harmed his case, and it might even have helped to reconcile us to it. But in other ways his neglect of the first-personal view, in the theory of personal identity as in his earlier discussion of one’s need to induce certain dispositions in oneself, leaves a gap. When we think how the argument is to be understood and applied, a dimension is missing.
In one respect, Parfit leaves it unclear whether he has adequately applied his metaphysical conclusions to his own argument. In the last part of the book, where population policy is in question, the idea that people are only aggregates of experiences seems to have been left behind. The whole discussion rests on a notion which seems uneasily related to that idea, the notion of ‘a life worth living’. All Parfit’s paradoxes involve the question whether the people in various populations have lives which are, or are not, worth living. But the discussions of personal identity and of prudence have earlier led us to distrust the ethical importance of a life at all. Perhaps a life worth living need not be taken to mean a life which as a whole will have been worth living. Perhaps it just means some living which, at any given time, is worth living. But Parfit cannot, as things stand, simply contract it to that. Almost the only clue that he gives to what is meant by saying that a life is not worth living is that people who had a life very much not worth living would kill themselves if they could. But he cannot use that notion without reference to the identity of the life that such a person would be ending. On his own view, that involves the question of the lives which suicide would be preventing: meaning by that, not the children that the agent would not have, but the selves that he would not become. Parfit cannot use the willingness to commit suicide as a neutral test of how a person values his or her own life. If imprudence is, as Parfit says, immorality, then suicide is murder.
There is another question raised by the section on population policy, besides those that come from the metaphysics of persons. That section tests more severely than any other part of the book the reliability of our ethical reactions when we are confronted with extreme and very abstractly presented possibilities. Correspondingly, it is the part that most calls in question Parfit’s refusal to raise questions of meta-ethics. Asked by him to say whether it would be better if there were two large populations, not connected with each other, each consisting of people whose life was just worth living, rather than one of those populations with a standard of life rather higher, or some yet more complex question of the same kind, I may wonder what I am being invited to do. What real substance can such judgments possess?
The problem presses all the more when I have, for once, a belief on these questions that seems very solid, but it turns out that theoretical argument may lay it aside. Very many of us believe in what Parfit calls ‘The Asymmetry’. If any child that I had now would (very probably) have a miserable life, that in itself would be some reason against my having a child now. On the other hand, if any child I have is likely to have quite a happy life, that fact in itself is no reason for having a child rather than not. We do not think in terms of doing the child a good turn by bringing him or her into existence. Parfit argues that we should probably think in those terms. To me, I must confess, it seems that ‘The Asymmetry’ is as clearly valid as anything is in this area, and while we certainly need a philosophical account of that impression, I do not see how theory acquires the power to cancel it. If moral philosophy is to do as much as Parfit hopes, by his very abstract means, it badly needs an account of the authority of theory.
However, here as elsewhere, the conflicts that Parfit has discovered are entirely real, and his imaginative and powerful arguments have uncovered deep questions which have in most cases never been explored so thoroughly, while, in other cases, they have barely been thought about at all. They are important questions, for practice as well as for philosophy, and in a moving last chapter, Parfit makes it clear how important he takes them to be. This ingenious, unusual, compelling book fully meets the importance of its questions.

Wickedness: A Philosophical Essay, by Mary Midgley
Mary Midgley believes that too many people suppose there to be no such thing as wickedness, and in the first part of her cheerful and chatty essay she sets about various outlooks that encourage their error.1 She criticises relativism, for instance, which makes people think that no-one is to be judged, and also a kind of fatalism supposedly based on science. We cannot do without morality, she claims, and hardly anyone thinks we can: those who claim to have got rid of it are really advancing some new morality, which in turn is likely to emphasise some selected parts of an old one.
If we have to believe in some morality or other, does it follow that we have to believe in wickedness? Mary Midgley assumes too readily that most of familiar morality, including a belief in ‘wickedness,’ stands or falls together. In particular, she seems disposed to think that any ethical outlook we might come to hold will not only preserve the institution of blame, but will continue to give it a special significance.
But this need not be so. We can be sceptical about some of our ethical thinking without giving it all up. We might agree that some people were nastier than others, more selfish, treacherous or brutal, and react to them appropriately, without thinking that these vices were their fault. Would we believe in wickedness?
We certainly would not have to believe that there was one state of the soul that all these odious people shared. Mary Midgley herself does not believe that. She is against a unitary account of wickedness, either in a metaphysical form, or in the scientific style that tries to find the roots of all undesirable behaviour in a force such as aggression. Wickedness, she believes, is a negation, consisting in the absence of the virtues. There are many different reasons why people do not act or feel as we would ethically like them to. This is surely correct: but then it is unclear why there is such a topic as the study of wickedness at all. There is no general account of people’s inabilities. Why does Mary Midgley think that there is a question for her essay to answer?
She takes there to be a question, I think, because some of the time, at least, she means more than this when she says that wickedness is a negation. Even when it consists in what looks like mere failure, in indifference, inconsiderateness, or brutality, she thinks that it is not merely a question of the agent’s being unable to do better. She believes, as many of us believe, that the agent could have noticed or cared, if only he had bothered to. In other cases again the agent’s intentions are (one might say) positively negative; his aim is itself to frustrate and hurt.
Why, she wants to ask, do people have such intentions? One answer that impresses her lies in the idea that wickedness is born of negation in a still deeper sense, that it comes from an emptiness that issues in envy and destructiveness. Some of the most thoughtful parts of her book are directed to this idea.
She makes some use of literature, and besides the perhaps predictable figures of Iago and Milton’s Satan, there is, interestingly, Dr Jekyll (‘any crash course on evil,’ she happily remarks, ‘must acknowledge a great debt to the Scots’). Freud is acknowledged, if a bit patronisingly, and she speculates briefly and suggestively about evolution. But at the end it is not quite clear how much she thinks these enquiries can explain, because it is still not clear what it is, in her view, that needs explaining.
Sheer motiveless destructiveness and malice invite explanation—that is why they are said to be motiveless. If that is what wickedness is, it indeed needs some special understanding. But when Mary Midgley assures us—reassures us, in fact—that there is such a thing as wickedness, when she repudiates the relativistic or fatalistic critics of morality as a whole, she has something wider than this in mind. ‘Wickedness’ then covers many more enemies of virtue, a whole range of ethical deformations—greed, possessiveness, resentment, cowardice, inconsiderateness.
Moral philosophers should indeed be more interested than they are in these things, and her book very helpfully tells them so. But she has not made it clear why, and how, such characteristics demand to be explained. This amiable essay is in several ways optimistic, and particularly because it finds something surprising in the fact that these are often our motives.

Secrets: On the Ethics of Concealment and Revelation, by Sissela Bok; The Secrets File: The Case for Freedom of Information in Britain Today, edited by Des Wilson
It is often said that the British are obsessively interested in secrecy. It is less often said how deep and peculiar this obsession is, and how much more there is to it than the well-known fact that British authorities are exceptionally secretive. Our interest is in secrecy as much as in secrets: it is the process, the practices and irregularities of keeping and revealing secrets, that concerns us. This interest in process rather than in content, together with the unconstructive and unfruitful nature of the obsession as it is regularly displayed, for instance, in the Sunday papers’ excitement about spies, makes it like an attachment to pornography. It is typical of it that we find it hard to distinguish fantasy and reality. The unceasing scratching at past espionage is obscene partly because fact and fiction have merged: Blunt, Bill Haydon, Smiley, Peter Wright seem by now all at the same distance.
This obsession with espionage is that of investigators, of unmaskers. Its motives even with regard to secrecy are complex. It is obvious that the need to unmask and then unmask again assorted Cambridge spies is concerned with more than the secrecy of the information they gave away. It is fascinated by their secrecy as spies; by sexual secrecy; and by the previously hidden life of a ruling class that excluded the rest of society from its secret garden. This rage of discovery is equalled by the obsession of people in charge to keep things secret, not simply with regard to espionage—something that is hardly surprising, particularly if one’s spies were also other people’s spies—but in all areas of government. As Sissela Bok’s book illustrates, it is a deep and nearly universal desire of those in power; Des Wilson’s collection of articles powerfully documents and eloquently attacks its special intensity in this country, the most officially secretive among democracies.1
Sissela Bok’s thoughtful book is not concerned only with official secrets, though they get a lot of attention. She discusses such things as the relations between secrecy, intimacy and privacy; there are many interesting observations, such as that the German word for ‘secret’ is directly connected with the word for ‘home’ (it is one of the words concentrated into the acronym Gestapo). She discusses self-deception, confession, professional confidentiality, police and journalistic investigations. She has some notable horror stories. There was the Holy Vehm, a secret vigilante organisation which was founded in mid-13th-century Westphalia and lasted until Napoleon. There is the chemical company which, having shipped the wrong additives to feed-grain co-operatives in Michigan, as a result of which many people had their health ruined and very many cattle died, threatened to sack any employee who helped investigators. For those who think academics more virtuous than business, there is the story of the social science experiment conducted in Pittsburgh in the Sixties, in which the investigator left schoolchildren alone with the spilled contents of a handbag in order to investigate their disposition to steal.
The book shares with Sissela Bok’s earlier work on lying a disposition to give an even-handed and very judicious appraisal of the ethical issues raised by these questions of public and private truth. It is not always quite clear, however, whom she is addressing. On gossip, for instance—an admirable subject in this connection—her sensible remarks take a slightly severe tone, but I doubt whether she expects to have much effect on the frivolous gossipers she condemns, while the others do not need to be told. Not that she is too severe. She is properly unreceptive to the extreme strictures of Kierkegaard, and to Heidegger, who wrote with all his characteristic deftness: ‘by its very nature, idle talk is a closing-off, since to go back to the ground of what is talked about is something which it leaves undone.’ With this kind of thing, she rightly says, ‘they erase differences and deny meaning in their own way.’
Sometimes her moral discussion speaks fairly directly to people who have to decide what to do in relation to the institutions of secrecy. Her chapter on ‘whistle-blowing’, one of her best, seems addressed to potential whistle-blowers, and asks what considerations you should have in mind if you are deciding whether to go public with the iniquities of the organisation that employs you. On other questions, she is concerned with what rules or practices would best serve the wide range of interests and rights involved. She rightly says that while there are of course many reasons why information should not be divulged, there are no reasons at all why the general considerations that govern official or professional practice should not themselves be public. Living in a society with a constitution, a Supreme Court, and many articulate lawyers, she is always conscious of these ideals of social transparency; in Britain, she would find the very idea of discussing the subject fairly unfamiliar, except at the level of evasive platitudes.
The deformations, in the USA as here, are not all in the same direction. If too much is hidden, too much is searched for, and often the wrong kinds of thing. The public’s ‘right to know’ is often called up in this connection: Sissela Bok is sharply critical of the way in which this idea is constantly misused. If someone has a right to know a particular thing, she argues, someone else must have a duty to disclose it. But often when the right to know is invoked, as the paparazzi swarm in the trees or reporters effectively prevent the negotiations they are supposed to report, it is perfectly obvious that no one has a duty to disclose—it is merely that they may be forced to.
The claim of a right to know is often bogus, but it is not always so. It does apply if the information you want to know is information about yourself held by some public body. It also applies to a lot of information relevant to public decisions. The book that Des Wilson has edited, on behalf of the Campaign for Freedom of Information in Britain, brings out, in a section on international comparisons, how remarkably far Britain is behind other countries in these respects: behind in legislation, and still further behind in the degree to which it is implemented. According to the claims made here, even France, that notorious monument of unaccountable state power qualified only by the unco-operativeness of its citizens, is more liberal in these matters than Britain.
Different problems are raised by freedom of information in the two kinds of case. In the individual case, there are some issues of protecting the administrative process from cranks and fanatical complainants, and from the sort of publicity which means that no one can ever write down a frank opinion of an employee or candidate. Beyond that, it is a matter of making sure that information can be known to those whom it concerns and not to others, and this is not easy, particularly when—as these books point out—information is increasingly held by many interrelated agencies.
In the case of information about such things as decisions of government and reasons of state, and issues of policy and administration, there are wider questions about what can properly be demanded and for what reasons it may be withheld, and both these books sensibly discuss them. This includes areas of research such as environmental pollution, where (an article by Maurice Frankel in Wilson’s book makes clear) public bodies, as things are, can have not only the right, but even the duty, to conceal information which is directly relevant to public concerns, and indeed to nailing polluters. The Wilson book is appropriately the more combative of the two. It emphasises yet again the dire influence of Section Two of the Official Secrets Act, which can be applied to any official transaction of any kind. This unreasonable and oppressive provision has been repeatedly criticised by the most respectable authorities, and survives only because it is selectively and hypocritically applied—which does not stop its being applied with extreme ferocity, as it was to Sarah Tisdall.2 I did not know until I read this book that it passed through all its Commons readings and the Committee stage in just thirty minutes, during a war scare in 1911.
There is another set of problems, though, beyond the general issue of reducing official secretiveness, and beyond the details of what can reasonably be concealed. This is the question of how things are to be made known. In the personal cases, once more, it is not basically too hard: someone who wants to know should be able to go and find out, without too much trouble, expense or bureaucratic obstruction. But it is a different matter with the issues of public concern. When the public indeed has a right to know, who exactly has a right to do what? If there is to be freedom of information, whose freedom will it be? Neither of these books faces up to these questions.
The point was illustrated when Crossman’s diaries were published. In the dispute about their appearance, there was a good deal of talk about the right to know, but it mostly neglected the point that as a source of knowledge about political events, Dick Crossman’s testimony—even his testimony to himself—needed, to put it mildly, a good deal of interpretation. His individual and sometimes malign preoccupations provided no surrogate for a Cabinet Hansard. It can rightly be said that more information, if not about the discussions in last week’s Cabinet (supposing there still is a Cabinet), would lessen our dependence on the preemptive memoirs of rival ex-Cabinet Ministers: but then there is the question of who releases what, and, above all, of the style in which it is made generally available.
Much would be achieved if important information, which could be found by interested people with skills to make it known, were more available than it is. But the right to know will be fully operative only if the media—the means, as they are supposed to be—are able to convey knowledge. Very little of the British press is willing to do that. It is not so much that it is untruthful or inaccurate, although it certainly is. It is rather that most of it makes truths meaningless, by presenting them in an instantaneous, superficial and fragmented way that defeats understanding. The state of the press is as much a problem for freedom of information as official silence is: it is the problem of making genuine information possible. TV in Britain is a more responsible and helpful medium than most of the press, but because it is transitory it cannot do things that only writing can do. No one has found a substitute for the coherent press that now barely exists in Britain.
These books are right: here as elsewhere, modern government is either deeply dedicated, or lazily attached, to concealment, and it is damaging and dangerous and deplorable. But the reluctance to let things out which is natural to all authority is wonderfully encouraged by the spectacle of what happens in Britain when they are let out. Many serious interests are defeated by excessive official secrecy, but it is not made easier for officialdom to remember that fact when most of the press does not represent any serious interest, or show any concern to make anything understood. The public, in some matters, does have a right to know, but the press cannot claim that right for itself until it makes itself able to provide the public with knowledge.

Choice and Consequence, by Thomas C. Schelling
This is a collection of papers that Schelling has written in the past twenty years or so, on subjects ranging from the general nature of game theory to nuclear deterrence, and from the psychology of self-control to the economic and corporate structure of organized crime.1 The pieces are grouped by subject, not ordered by date (you have to do some digging in the book to find out when they were written). They are of varying weights and depths. Some contain detailed pieces of analysis, while in other places Schelling goes on in a more ruminating style, praising Thucydides as a strategic analyst or reflecting on the problems of giving up smoking. They are well written, always interesting, sometimes brilliant, and demand little technical knowledge: some, notably the essay on game theory, in fact offer it, in a very handy form.
Some of these papers demonstrate remarkably how economic concepts can be used intelligently to raise new questions about society and to suggest answers to them, in a way that can provide understanding without necessarily deploying new facts or even very unfamiliar ones. Particularly striking are the two articles (which slightly overlap) about crime, “Economics and Criminal Enterprise” and “What Is the Business of Organized Crime?” In these very clever and illuminating pieces Schelling first defines organized crime, as not merely crime that is organized, in the way that a squad of cooperative burglars with complementary skills might be, but as crime which seeks a monopoly. He goes on to discuss a whole range of questions, considering for instance what the structural conditions of an activity are that make it an appropriate business for organized crime; who its economic victims are; the resemblances of extortion to taxation; the reasons why those engaged in extortion may prefer to overcharge for an unwanted service, rather than merely removing money. These articles are interesting for more than the insight they give into crime. They should be read by political philosophers, for sobering thoughts both about the limits that may restrict legitimate power, and also about the nature of that power.
Differences in outlook between academic professions can parallel variations in what each finds surprising or unsurprising. Philosophers and others are often surprised (until they become old, cynical and well-read in the work of strategic analysts and decision theorists) at what those writers, like others who belong to the economic professions, can find surprising: such as the oft-overlooked fact that human beings seem actually not to measure the value of people’s lives in terms of their discounted production potential or some such criterion. In this respect, Schelling is one of the most honorable exceptions, and sturdily refuses to be astonished by humans behaving like humans. A famous essay of 1968, “The Life You Save May Be Your Own,” discusses ways in which lives, and in particular various possibilities of lives being lost, can be assigned prices.
The worth of that discussion is much enhanced by the way in which Schelling reveals without gush that he knows that there is more to the value of life and the horror of death than economics is going to catch. “I doubt whether this kind of population economics is worth all the arithmetic,” he writes. “At best it is the way a family will deal with the loss of a cow, not the loss of a collie. Though children are not pets, in the United States they are more like pets than like livestock, and it is doubtful whether the interests of any consumers are represented in a calculation that treats a child like an unfinished building or some expensive goods in process.” He displays an unsentimental tact which affects the content and the tone of his discussions. If a salary earner dies, “we should distinguish … between his life and his livelihood. His family will miss him, and it will miss his earnings. We do not know which of the two in the end it will miss most, and if he died recently this is a disagreeable time to inquire.”
There are some subjects on which Schelling still seems to me more surprised than he should be. He is puzzled by the fact that a person sometimes behaves and feels like two people, giving commands and making resolutions which are often ignored or have to be enforced with external help. Though Schelling gives many striking examples and evidently knows how common such things are, he seems taken aback by the discovery of them. He is certainly puzzled, as many philosophers have been from Plato and Aristotle onwards, about how best to describe such cases, but here his puzzlement does not seem to find a sharp enough focus: in particular, despite sophisticated recent discussion by Jon Elster (to whom he refers) and others, he remains too attached to a simple version of the two-person model, and some of his speculations, for instance on ways in which the law might conceivably reinforce the prudent and respectable motivations, involve taking the model too seriously.
The book is subtitled Perspectives of an Errant Economist. As I have already implied, these essays are free from kinds of reductionism which non-economists often find a galling feature of economists’ reflections on policy—galling, that is to say, when the economist claims or does not deny that it is policy he or she is discussing in these terms rather than economic aspects of policy. Schelling can press economic formulations in uncomfortable ways, but he knows where and why they are uncomfortable. A theme he comes back to more than once concerns the rights or wrongs of running aircraft, ships and so on with lower safety standards for customers who do not want or cannot afford a better and more expensive service. He knows that this may be found a rather distasteful proposal, but reasonably asks why. At the same time, he recognizes that the success of organized society depends on traditions, attitudes, beliefs and rules that may appear extravagant or sentimental to a confirmed materialist (if there is one). The sinking of the Titanic illustrates the point. There were enough lifeboats for first class; steerage was expected to go down with the ship. We do not tolerate that any more. Those who want to risk their lives at sea and cannot afford a safe ship should perhaps not be denied the opportunity to entrust themselves to a cheaper ship without lifeboats; but if some people cannot afford the price of passage with lifeboats, and some people can, they should not travel on the same ship.
It is all the more interesting that there are some points at which reductionism still gets in his way. It particularly shows itself in the opening essay, “Economic Reasoning and the Ethics of Policy,” a fairly recent piece, where there are strong traces of two basic types of reductionism, both very typical of economic writing about ethical issues in policy making. One of them is more expressive of moralism than of materialism (though those two things were of course made for each other). This is the idea that the only ethical outlook relevant to policy is the attitude of being disinterested or impartial. “The ethics of policy,” Schelling writes, “is the relevant ethics when we try to think disinterestedly about rent control [etc.] … I want to define the ethics of policy as what we try to bring to bear on those issues in which we do not have a personal stake. It is hard to find issues that are absolutely unsoiled with personal interest. On abortion and capital punishment our personal ethics usually dominate.” (Schelling’s emphasis.)
But he cannot think, and surely does not mean, that on those issues our personal interests are usually involved. What he means is that people have ethical opinions on these subjects which they care about and which are not simply a reflection of how they see everyone’s interests. Schelling’s own understanding, shown in many other places, is that people do have such attitudes, and it would have to be a very crass confusion of personal attitude and personal self-interest that would make one deny that those were ethical attitudes. Indeed, Schelling does not deny that they are—he merely says that they are personal ethical attitudes. But then it is not clear why they cannot be brought to bear on policy issues. The claim that they cannot needs more than a blank appeal to the ethical as impartiality. It needs a very particular account of the nature of the state.
Sometimes, Schelling goes in the other direction, and seems to suggest that the process of thinking impartially and in economic terms about policy eliminates the need for the ethical. If we think about rent control or gasoline vouchers, medical facilities or safety equipment, in the spirit of asking what we would hope to get if we were a recipient and what we would be prepared to give as a taxpayer, we may come to agreement: “And it would not strike us as an ethical issue.” But it would be an ethical issue, and there is no reason why it would not strike us as one. The economic and contractualist formulations (those are not of course necessarily the same thing) do not eliminate ethical thought: they offer one way of thinking about (some) ethical issues.
These ways of thinking, moreover, as Schelling applies them, do involve another kind of reductionism. He is committed to thinking that when there is a question of distributing or providing certain goods, it must help to get things straight if one thinks in terms of turning those goods into money. On airport safety, once more, there is an ingenious discussion on what happens if we agree that you should get some of the tax money needed to buy airport lights, and you are left free not to buy airport lights with it. But the assumptions of substitutability that run through these discussions deny something that elsewhere Schelling willingly admits, that we think of some goods—life, safety, public health and order—as not simply goods that one is free to buy or not to buy. It follows that if people are thought to have a right or claim to them, which policy should honor, what has to be honored is an interest in those goods, not an interest in money which, if it is not spent on something else, might buy them. Indeed, there is something near to a contradiction in these arguments. Some important lack or need is identified in a section of society, for education, health, safety or whatever; when the question is raised of providing for this need, it is said that it would serve both efficiency and freedom better if the people involved were given money with which, if so disposed (and, one may add, sufficiently organized and so on), they can choose to provide for the need themselves. But those who make this argument have no brief for economic equality as such, and if the disadvantaged people had merely pointed out that they had less money than the others, there would have been no suggestion that they should therefore be given more. It is only because they were asking for those things that the discussion got going in the first place, and the idea came up that anyone should give them anything.
The reductivist economic argument neglects the ethical and, indeed, anthropological truths that not all social goods mean the same thing, and that they do not all mean the same as money: a truth well stressed by Michael Walzer in his recent Spheres of Justice, and (as I have already said) well known to Schelling, at least when he is not discussing this kind of argument. It also neglects, or prefers to forget, a political truth, that when the original claim is turned into a claim for money, it is less likely to be honored. This is hardly surprising: if it had originally been a claim for more money, it would not have been listened to, except by egalitarians. In what Schelling calls difficult times (“it is the problems, not the times, that are hard”), one very important effect of seeing all social goods as money is that they can all with less difficulty be cut. Particularly when Schelling is talking about what he is doing, he tends to admit a reductionism about economic motivation and a restricted view of what is involved in living in an ethical community, which turn against the admirable concessions to human reality which he makes at other places.
Indeed, there is a question whether his concessions should not carry him further than he has gone at any point in this book. As the opening piece rightly implies by its position, a good deal of the economic analysis is related ultimately to policy: the idea at the back of the discussions, naturally enough, is that these ways of looking at transport safety, risk estimation or whatever, should be carried into practices for our society. They are indeed used in our society, and those ways of thinking, or very much crasser versions of them, standardly figure in social practice and political rhetoric at the present time. But the point Schelling so admirably made about the Titanic must apply more widely. Perhaps some people should be allowed to pay for better health care, while others with less money should not be denied the opportunity to entrust themselves to worse standards of medicine. But then they should not travel in the same society—or, perhaps, on the same planet.2

Privacy: Studies in Social and Cultural History, by Barrington Moore, Jr.
The more time that citizens spend thinking about public matters, Rousseau said, and the less about their own private affairs, the better a society is. One good test of political sentiments is whether you find this thought invigorating or repellent. Either reaction to it, however, implies that you have an understanding of the contrast, some conception of the private.
Barrington Moore’s book raises the very interesting question of what that conception may be.1 His approach is to consider the quite different ideas of privacy and different attitudes toward it that are to be found in various cultures, thus bringing out the complexities of our own ideas of privacy. There are the privacies of intimacy, such as sexual privacy, which seem, except in ritual and other special practices, to be observed in a very wide range of cultures. (“The preference for seclusion appears to be overwhelming,” as Moore puts it.) Much less widely observed is privacy for defecating and urinating, and among those functions male urination tends to make the lightest demands on privacy, something that used to be illustrated in the streets of Paris by a sparsely enclosed urinal, the vespasienne. (That revealing device has now been replaced by a strange, enclosed structure that is divided equally between the sexes and conceals its purpose so discreetly as to seem thoroughly suspicious.)
For an activity to be private in these ways, it needs only to be hidden; the concealment, as in the vespasienne, can be quite local: other people may readily know what someone, in private, is doing. Other kinds of privacy involve secrecy, as with the undisclosed transactions that take place in a family or among friends. Often, of course, as with other secrets, they are not so much undisclosed as unacknowledged, and what is indecent or embarrassing is to show that one knows. In Eskimo life, about which Moore gives some information, the cramped conditions of the igloo make heavy demands on this kind of convention.
In still other cases, experience is private because it is free from demands or obligations imposed by others. One is free to read, or to go to the movies, or to travel where one wants. This need not have anything specially to do with hiddenness or secrecy; it is merely accepted that at certain times one may do what one wants rather than what one is required to do. Moore particularly stresses this idea, and it is perhaps his central conception of privacy. But it immediately raises several questions. When the private is contrasted with public life or public concerns, as it is by Rousseau’s remark, the world of the private does not have to be understood as one in which there are no obligations—rather, it is one in which there are no public obligations. Within my private life, I may be under an obligation to visit my mother; but if I am obliged, for example, to take part in political meetings, work on civic projects, participate in public ceremonies, or serve in the army, those obligations reduce the sphere of private life.
When we think about it in this way, the idea of the public seemingly comes first, and the private has to be understood as what, in time or space or feeling or social situation, is exempted from it. That idea takes a special form when, further, people claim a right not to be constrained by certain public demands. Any such right defines a kind of activity which is, in a way, private—expressing opinions, for instance, or publishing what one wants, or carrying on business. But we are now a long way from our starting point, and what is private in one sense may be public in another. Publication and free speech are both the opposites of secret, and these “private” activities can in their own way be contrasted with the privacies of hiddenness or intimacy.
How are these different aspects of privacy related to one another? Do they go together in various cultures? How far, starting from the narrowest concept of physical privacy, should one go to defend a substantial private life against public demands, resisting Rousseau and the claims of communal consciousness?
Barrington Moore asks these questions and encourages one to think about them, but he does not offer much help in answering them. He has produced a collection of materials rather than a book, and a collection, moreover, with some eccentric features. It is arranged on a comparative scheme, telling us about four different kinds of society and inviting us to consider them together with our own. He starts with one or two very simple traditional societies, each of them more or less lacking a formal authority. These primitive communities characteristically lack any developed contrast between public and private, but one of several interesting points is that even at these very basic levels of organized life some societies encourage people to be more reticent or self-contained than others do—differences partly (but only partly) related to their various styles of hunting or food gathering.
Many of the anthropological reports that Moore quotes are well worth reading. They should be studied by anyone (if there still is anyone) who entertains fantasies of the noble savage and the satisfying wholeness of the primitive life. One tribe in particular, the Siriono Indians of South America, is, as Moore describes it, startlingly horrible. The Siriono ceaselessly fight among themselves, hide food from one another, pay no attention to cripples, have a sense neither of privacy nor of common interests. The Jívaro Indians of Ecuador sound not much more amiable; about them Moore, no friend of Christianity, cheerfully remarks that as a whole, their “society and culture recall the Western European world of Gregory of Tours.” To read some of the material in these early sections requires a strong stomach. One description of “penis bleeding” during a male initiation rite in the New Guinea highlands is so appalling that one wonders what anyone could learn about privacy from being forced to read it, beyond the generally useful reminder that even when privacy takes its most solitary and anomic modern urban forms, there are vivid styles of community life that are worse.
Moore next pursues the theme of privacy in classical Athens, emphasizing the peculiar relations between private initiative and public expectation that were held to produce good results for the general public in that society. Rich men were expected to pay for the choruses for the dramatic festivals, for instance, or for the triremes of the navy, as matters of individual public service. Going through, somewhat discursively, many aspects of Athenian social history, Moore shows how the Athenians tended to think that a fully developed life for someone who was adult, male, and a citizen involved public, indeed political, activity. The Greek term for a private person, he observes, is the direct ancestor of the word “idiot.”
The private life that men (but not women) were expected to transcend was the domestic life, and they were expected to act to an important degree outside the home, in public places and in the presence of others. However, this distinction between the public and the domestic was not simply the distinction between what was displayed and what was hidden from the neighbor’s attention. Domestic disorder and sexual irregularities were both acknowledged as being of strong public interest, and were subject to various restrictions. Yet the first democracy was already able to formulate a conception of the tyranny of public opinion; in a remarkable passage, which I did not find in Moore’s book, Thucydides presents Pericles as saying:
The freedom that we enjoy in our government extends to our everyday relations to each other. There, far from exercising a jealous surveillance over each other, we do not feel called upon to be angry with our neighbour for doing what he likes, or even to indulge in those injurious looks which cannot fail to be offensive although they inflict no positive penalty.
Moore does not go very far or very professionally into the scholarship of these matters, quoting for the most part from what must have been a punishingly copious reading of Demosthenes and one or two other writers. When he gets beyond the Greeks, he relies even less on historical research, and confines himself in each case to taking points from one or two literary sources. The subject that follows the Greeks is not pre-Christian Jewish society, but the Old Testament (“the Revised Standard Version,” he unnervingly remarks in a note, “is presumably more accurate”), and he seems not particularly vexed by questions of what sort of document, or set of documents, it is; even the claim that Solomon had 700 wives and 300 concubines he apparently takes to be a historical fact. He clearly has a personal distaste for Yahweh, and tends to find the Hebrews a tiresome and fanatical crew, regretting that they did not produce a more powerfully secular and analytic historian of themselves: “If a Hebrew Thucydides had been possible,” he remarks—a wonderful possibility indeed—“our conception of that society might be quite a different one.”
If he finds the Old Testament irritating, the classical Chinese writers who provide his last body of evidence seem to have proved rather wearying, and nothing very interesting comes from his reports of them. His attempt to base his account on comparative social history, after its opening movements, seems to have failed him. I wish in fact that he had laid aside some of the Athenian orators and the selections from translated Chinese sages, so that he could tell us how he sees the differing aspects of privacy as fitting together in the modern world, a question he interestingly raises in his closing pages.
There is a “modern pathology” of privacy, he remarks, meaning by that the defensive solitude, the unwillingness to get involved or come to the help of others, that are notorious in the modern city. It is perhaps wrong to see such behavior as simply an exaggeration of positive values that people have conferred on privacy in modern times. It can be seen as something quite different from those values and even opposed to them, since it is based on fear and indifference. A genuine recognition of others’ privacy need not be based on those reactions, it could be argued, but can come from a respect for other people rather than from a lack of interest in them. There is something in this argument, but we also have some reason to be grateful that it often does not apply to the lives we lead. If one is not simply condemned to solitude, but actively wants privacy in order to protect one’s happiness or to deal with one’s unhappiness, one may be pleased that those around, rather than respecting one’s rights with concern and restraint, simply do not give a damn.
One of the historical achievements of bourgeois culture has been the development of private life. Some features of that culture, including those that have most notably provided the makings of the novel, are falling victim to further developments of individual freedom itself. As Moore says, the special intensities of romantic love probably flourish most against a background of publicly supported conventions. He does not mean simply sexual conventions and the obstacles that they can provide. There also needs to be a convincing world of social rules and understandings that surrounds and conditions such a relationship. The rattle of Woody Allen’s ironies, like the bleaker Bloomsbury memoirs and correspondence, reminds us that if all that is interesting to lovers is each other, there may not be much of interest.
I do not see how our societies can be kept going unless people are willing to acknowledge in some way the idea of a public order that means more than simply what is “out there.” This would mean seeing others as citizens and not just as residents or wanderers on the same patch of ground. But the sense of shared citizenship that we need does not exclude or even weaken individual rights, such as the rights to privacy. On the contrary, it requires them. We have a sense of citizenship only if we think that others are like us, and one way in which we know that they are like us is that they need to be protected, as we want to be, from destructive and unpredictable intrusions, whether by the state or by other agencies.
The right to privacy, in its more intimate senses, is closely connected with the capacity to form close personal and family relationships, which must involve a circle of information and experience from which others are excluded.2 (Edmund Leach, when he lambasted the institution of the family in his Reith Lectures, A Runaway World, particularly deplored its “squalid secrets.”) Various reformers, revolutionaries, and social theorists who have stressed the values of community and citizenship have wanted to counteract the influences of personal and family loyalties, seeing them as potentially divisive and disloyal when they are exercised in their usual place. Rousseau was only one of many who have hoped to dissolve the private into the public. It is not merely Robespierrean champions of the virtuous republic who have done this, or Hitlerian embodiments of the less virtuous nation. Even some Fabians, too, in less oppressive style, have been suspicious of private life as a self-indulgence, and have despised what they have seen as its triviality and its lack of public commitment—the lack memorably expressed by Wilde in his remark that socialism would take too many evenings.
There are no psychological reasons at all to trust the policy of trying to affirm a useful sense of citizenship by destroying the private or by compulsorily extending it (which comes to the same thing); and there are many historical reasons for fearing it. A modern program to extend the sense of sharing in a community has to start from justice rather than fraternity, and has to recognize that social justice means something only if it acknowledges individual lives that have their own loyalties and are not entirely shaped to its demands. Rousseau’s dismissal of private life in the interests of community was not only wrong and harmful; it was self-defeating, and a deeper understanding of privacy will help to show us why.

Ordinary Vices, by Judith Shklar; Immorality, by Ronald Milo
Judith Shklar’s Ordinary Vices is a wise, clever, thoughtful book about the danger and the value of various personal vices—cruelty, hypocrisy, snobbery and others.1 Professor Shklar asks how important they are; which are worse than others; what they can positively do for society, and how their meanings differ from one society to another. She uses a wide range of writers, but her book gives far more than a well-written set of reflections on what has been thought about these bad characteristics. It also explains and (in a fairly unassertive style) defends a certain view of society and politics, a liberal view, in terms of which these vices can be ordered and understood. The connection works in the other direction, too: if you think that cruelty, for instance, is more important than other vices, that will already lead you in certain political directions. Judith Shklar, like her heroes Montaigne and Montesquieu, thinks that cruelty is more important than anything—that it comes first, as she puts it.
She is good at detecting cruelty. She finds it, for instance, in the heart of some philanthropy, but unlike others who have made that discovery, she does not give up hating it. Moreover, unlike some others who hate cruelty, she is alert to the dangers of that hatred: in particular, its ready decline into a desolating misanthropy which can itself be a source of cruelty. It is essential to hold back misanthropy, which can destroy almost any virtue. What holds it back is not merely benevolence, or any other virtue; for Montaigne, it was uniquely friendship that ‘resists that avalanche of disgust which can at any moment overwhelm anyone’.
Because she puts cruelty first and fears misanthropy, she distrusts the special hatred that much modern feeling reserves for hypocrisy. She quotes a long passage from the ‘stunning scene’ in which Uriah Heep—‘looking flabby and lead-coloured in the moonlight’—explains to David Copperfield the experiences that showed him the value of being ’umble. ‘Dickens was a great connoisseur of hypocrisy,’ she writes, ‘yet he was not obsessive about it … Why has his sense of humanity been so rare? Why are people so overwhelmed by loathing for hypocrisy?’ In answering her question, she explores, as Hegel did, the modern virtue of sincerity: in particular, a sincerity which, in the absence of agreed ethical standards, may dangerously take on the role of providing the ethical standard all by itself. She points out that those who denounced the insincerities of Victorian capitalism probably did less, in doing that, to alleviate its horrors than the liberal reformers who had their own styles of insincerity. She reasonably reminds us that in many circumstances, especially extreme ones, it may not matter very much what people’s motivations are, and a nice concern that they should match what people say can wait for less demanding times.
All this is finely done, but she gives most of her attention to self-conscious hypocrites, or at least to those who do not have to look very far to detect their own dishonesty. One of her favourite authors, Molière, provides a gross instance, Tartuffe, and an example also of the destructive hatred of hypocrisy, in Alceste, the misanthrope, with his fear of being deceived. But that fear, which is indeed a powerful political and ethical force, is not directed only against self-conscious deceivers. Those who have been called the three great unmaskers in modern thought, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, all alert us to forms of deceit that do not merely overlay personal or social motivations, but help to constitute those motivations. In the spirit that these writers helped to create, those nowadays who are concerned with truth at all are often worried that they may be living a false life or in a false world. The impulse to uncover these falsehoods may very often leave us only in a state of unfocused, debilitating and resentful suspicion, but the impulse itself, and the desire to live truthfully, are not merely superficial features of the modern world—least of all as that world is conceived by liberalism—nor are they merely the legacy of a self-destructive Protestant Christianity (though, as Nietzsche said, they are certainly that as well).
Judith Shklar encourages us to accept a fair measure of evasion and bogusness, and so far as personal relations are concerned, she gives some good reasons for adding this to the platform of the campaign against misanthropy. But I doubt that it will be enough to stop her liberals being nagged by the need for truthfulness, or even being overcome, on a bad day, by disgust at the complacent, evasive and self-serving rubbish that piles up in our channels of communication. The aspiration for a society and a life that understand themselves, or at any rate can reasonably think that they are not based on deceit, goes deep with us: indeed, the appeal of her own text has a lot to do with that aspiration. Her book must be read in the tradition of those who force us to become undeceived about the humbug which has helped to make people too keen on killing one another.
Snobbery comes next in her catalogue after hypocrisy, and she thinks that they are connected: ‘the link,’ she writes, ‘is obvious enough: both are false claims to merit; both are expressions of utter insincerity.’ I cannot understand this, any more than her definition of snobbery as ‘the habit of making inequality hurt’. It seems to me that people can be great snobs who are entirely sincere and who also think that it would be either bad form or a waste of time to hurt those they see as their inferiors. At one point I wondered whether Judith Shklar’s account suffered from the archetypal snobbish error about snobbery—that it can afflict only those who are not actually in a superior position. But I think that the thinness of this section, the weakest in the book, comes rather from two other causes. In the first place, and very much so, she is American, and while, as she makes very clear, there is a great deal of American snobbery, it tends to be rather simple: uncomplicatedly unpalatable, like some kinds of American food. Again, snobbery, like insomnia, is something that you really find interesting only if you suffer from it. Both reasons taken together suggest that to write well on snobbery one had better be English (for instance) and a snob: Harold Nicolson, whom she quotes, did better on this tiresome subject than she does.
She scores some good hits, for all that. She points out that ‘two of Europe’s main racist theorists, Gobineau and Lapouge, were bogus counts. Snobbery and racism, in fact, belong to the same family: cousins.’ She ruthlessly nails the dangers of the radical snobbery that can lead to dazzling political ambitions in academics. She is rather too kind about this phenomenon in Britain, but she thinks that it creates ‘political expectations and daily manners that are useless and indeed self-defeating in America. The most recent public display of these illusory hopes was by the servile and fantasy-ridden court that gathered around President Kennedy.’ There is a remark about university snobbery itself, as seen in her own institution, that leaves it wonderfully unclear whether her characteristic irony is or is not in play: ‘it is a snobbery that does not follow from the recognised fact that Harvard is indeed a very great university, perhaps the greatest, but from the fancy that it is the only one that matters.’
Judith Shklar sees her book as belonging to political theory, and that is an important fact about it, particularly because some of it does not seem like that, looking rather as if its reflections lay in the ethics of individual life. But it is precisely their relations to personal morality and to individual character that define the concerns of her political theory. In one section, her excellent discussion of betrayal, her concern is directly to bring the domestic and the political together, to remind us, for one thing, how unspecial the circumstances of political treachery may be. ‘Some people are so passive and so unaware of the character and activities of their friends that they virtually collaborate in their own betrayals. The complaisant husband used to be such a figure; but a careless, class-bound intelligence service, such as the British, is no different.’ She has an outstanding section on ‘My Country or My Friends’, which is the best thing I have ever read about E. M. Forster’s famous remark to the effect that if it came to it, he hoped that he would have the courage to betray the first rather than the second. ‘Even without its heroics,’ she starts, ‘this is not an intelligent statement,’ and it is hard to see how anyone, two pages later, could disagree.
In her last chapter, Judith Shklar describes her book as ‘a tour of perplexities, not a guide for the perplexed’. In that chapter she delicately nudges our perplexities about the relations in a modern liberal state between personal character, both of citizens and rulers, and the state’s impersonal system of law and administration. There is more connection between them, she concludes, than the founders of liberalism hoped, but less, much less, than is demanded by those who see it as the business of the state to make men good. She embraces in this what she calls a ‘liberalism of fear’, and agrees with Montesquieu that ‘the real point … is not to paint the free citizen as a virtuous person, but to insist that without freedom everyone is intolerably paralysed or demeaned.’ To put cruelty first is to acknowledge that ‘one fears nothing more than fear,’ and the political consequences of acknowledging it, she rightly claims, are enormous. Many have felt, in the past, and once again now, that it is impossible to reconcile, to the extent that liberalism needs, a state seen merely as impersonal regulation, and an ethical life understood in terms of personal character and sentiment. She does not claim to tell us how to do it, and she may possibly underestimate its difficulty: but she rightly makes this question central, and she leads us in a compelling way to some of its deepest implications.
In allocating her work to ‘political theory’, Judith Shklar implies that it is not, or not simply, philosophy. Ronald Milo’s book illustrates in this respect, as in others, her wisdom.2 Immorality is a competently argued, and hence all the more depressing, example of Anglo-American moral philosophy at its most arid. As is often the case in this subject, it argues for something that no sane person ever denied except in philosophy: that there are many different ways in which people may come to do the wrong thing—through having the wrong moral ideas, for instance, or having the right ones but being too weak or negligent to act on them, or simply not caring what morality says. These and other possibilities are distinguished and sensibly defended against implausible and very abstract philosophical arguments claiming that they are impossible. But the discussion is oppressively controlled by these arguments themselves, so that most of it is very thin controversy and little of it realistic moral psychology. It suffers, too, from a standard deformation of the genre, which consists in subscribing to the unity of the philosophical profession through the ages. The people referred to are those who turn up in philosophy courses: this practice excludes all great writers with three or four exceptions, and also unblinkingly brackets together geniuses of philosophy, authors of half-forgotten textbooks, and the author’s colleagues, so there is a good deal of, as it were, ‘this view is held by Aristotle, Trubshaw and, in his earlier article, Birnbacher.’
The most important weakness of Milo’s discussion, however, comes from its exclusive attachment to the notion of morality. This has two results, which together more or less kill off the inquiry before it starts. The agent who is considering what to do is represented as thinking that a certain action is ‘morally wrong’ or ‘morally right’, and the question of how his actions are related to that thought is then discussed. But this is at best a very special case. We can understand our capacity to behave badly only if we start from the obvious fact that we think most of the time in much more specific ethical terms. When we go wrong, it is often because we think, for instance, that a piece of cruelty is just, or an injustice is helpful, or that to avoid some brutal act would be cowardly. The space in which those self-deceptions can occur is the same as that occupied by sounder thoughts, and it is much larger, and provides many more hiding places, than the area provided simply by ‘right’ and ‘wrong’. The influence of the morality system shows up, too, in what is said about our own or others’ reproaches. The only question for Milo seems to be whether one is blamed or excused, as though we were dealing with some transcendental penal system. In fact, our ethical life is made of many more reactions than those, and they play a large part in the account of how we may live well or badly. How does ‘morality’ deal with the many reasons for behaving badly that lie in the desire to be loved? As another of its ‘temptations’, no doubt, like a craving for marmalade.
That her book is about political theory means for Judith Shklar that it is in good part about history, and one of the things that she understands historically is the abstract morality system itself, and the problems that it has generated since it came into being. This history is our history, and her book is specially rich because its psychological understanding is rooted in history; for the same reason, the historical materials she gives us are unfailingly interesting. Unlike a lot of what is called ‘moral philosophy’, her admirable book is not all about books, and when it is about books, it is about good ones, of many different kinds.

The Right to Know: The Inside Story of the Belgrano Affair, by Clive Ponting; The Price of Freedom, by Judith Cook
Two months ago I was in a country where, in a dreadful economic situation, surrounded by memories of a recent and very nasty tyranny, and conscious that the forces that had sustained the tyranny had not simply disappeared, people close to the government were discussing in a very concerned and scrupulous way the limits of free speech; the independence of the judiciary; the extent to which justice requires the law to be definite and not to rely on vague and catch-all phrases; how far it is an adequate defence of what public servants may do that they are obeying orders or carrying out the policies of government. Lawyers, philosophers, administrators in that country are struggling to place a democracy securely on ground that for the past fifty years has not been at all receptive to it, and they are trying to do so in a way that makes intellectual sense.
That country is Argentina, and it is one of several deep ironies that surround Britain’s relations to it that the new democratic government there should be seriously concerned with a correct understanding of these questions of individual rights, while the British government tries to discipline its public servants with a vague law that no one with any respect for rights can accept, and British judges are prepared to interpret that law with formulae that would certainly, now, be unacceptable in Argentina. It is a further irony that the most recent and dramatic case in which that law was brought to bear, the prosecution of Clive Ponting, was concerned with the conduct of the war to which, together with the junta’s own folly, the present Argentinian government owes its existence.
Argentina’s democratic government is probably Mrs Thatcher’s finest achievement. She does not seem to value that achievement, as opposed to having won a war “against Argentina”; if she did, she would allow the diplomats to be a little more flexible in their formulations about the future—the distant future—of the Falklands, as it is rumoured that they would like to be. There are virtually no Argentinians who doubt that the islands belong to Argentina, and while the subject is not at the top of any agenda, it might be important to the Argentinian government that it could show some progress on the question. At the moment the democratic government still has breathing-space, because the military are discredited and anti-democratic opponents are tainted by association with them. But it needs all the help it can get, and it might help if it could point to a trace of a hope of future negotiation. If British policy insists on being as obstinate with the democracy as with the junta, it neglects the only good thing that the war achieved.
Members of the junta are now on trial, before a civilian court. The government has been accused of insufficient zeal in pursuing the crimes of the previous régime; while I was in Buenos Aires, a party of Socialist members of the European Parliament arrived to give the Argentinians the benefit of their disapproval on this subject. The complaints are that the authorities have taken too long and that they are not prosecuting enough people. There was a purpose behind the delay. For both constitutional and political reasons, the military had first to be given the option of dealing with the crimes in a military court. They had a predictable difficulty in either accepting or refusing, and did nothing. When the time-limit expired, the cases came to a civilian court, a procedure which also brings with it television coverage, which has been giving the Argentinian people a sustained and painful history of the junta’s activities.
The question of how many should be prosecuted, and how far down the line punishment should travel, raises the issue of the “Nuremberg principle”, whether acting under military orders can count as a defence for acts that would otherwise be criminal. It also raises questions of policy. An indefinite campaign to pursue everyone who has committed brutal acts under the previous régime may not be the best way to reconcile the better elements of the military to a democratic government, or to help people to take the existence of that government as an irreversible fact.
The questions of principle that interest the thoughtful people close to President Alfonsín run in the other direction as well. How far should those in command be held responsible for brutalities if they did not authorize or know about them? In practice, however, a lot of evidence at the trial suggests that these were not commanders whose behaviour need raise any very refined questions of this kind. A notorious instance quoted to us was the matter of the undertakers of Córdoba, who wrote to the then President (not Galtieri) to seek compensation for the extra work generated by the large detention centre in that city: the President replied that they had a case, but their submission should properly be made to the governor of the province.
Another, perhaps more typical, example came up at the trial on the afternoon we had the opportunity to visit it. A young woman appeared, a schoolteacher, who had been associated with the trade union. Her evidence was that one evening she had been picked up, thrown into one of the famous Ford Falcons, taken to a detention centre, and tortured. Later, her blindfold was removed, and she was confronted by an imposing military figure. “You know who I am?” he said; it was Galtieri. “You know that I have the power of life and death over you?” She accepted it. “What is your name?” She told him. “It is the name of my daughter. You may live.”
Granted a recent history of such crude and melodramatic tyranny, the concern shown by the present decent and determined government for human rights and for their detailed interpretation may seem to some heroic or even quixotic. To the people we talked to who were associated with government it seemed, simply, essential; if they did not do everything they could to stick to the rules and to develop respect for them, their government was nothing and there was no reason why they should be in power rather than someone else. Many British people, I suspect, may cheerfully agree with them to the extent of thinking that such practices may well be a good thing for Argentina. It is a typical British reaction to think that an insistence on formulating individual rights may be needed in a country that lacks a democratic tradition, a history of orderly change and citizenly good sense—it is part of the price one pays for an unhappy history: in a country such as ours, however, where a better past has left us with a shared sense of what counts as fair and reasonable behaviour, such obsessions are irrelevant and probably damaging.
Clive Ponting’s book, The Right to Know, is important not just for what it tells about the history of the sinking of the Argentinian ship General Belgrano, but because it shows particularly clearly that these complacent assumptions about British life and the justice of our arrangements will not do.1 On the history itself, only an expert in the complex subject that Tam Dalyell calls “Belgrano studies” could say whether all the details are correct. Even those who know about these events only by following the newspapers will recognize that there is at least one matter—his delay in owning up—that Ponting passes over. Occasionally it is less than clear what is report and what is speculation—on the question, for instance, whether the commander of HMS Conqueror, the submarine that sank the Belgrano, sought confirmation of the order to do so. But in general it is a well-told, unpretentious and impressive tale. It is forgivable, I think, that Ponting should emphasize the respects in which Dalyell was right in his dogged pursuit of the government, and should say little about the wilder suggestions which may have done something to leave the impression that this is a crank’s and bore’s subject raising no very substantial issues. It is certainly not that. Beyond the immediate issues, which are important enough, of how this government behaved, the affair raises central questions about our political culture.
The circumstances surrounding the decisions that empowered the Navy to sink the Belgrano on May 2, 1982, when it had been sailing away from the Task Force for eleven hours, are very clearly set out, so far as they are known: in a few important respects, they remain obscure. Ponting does not press any charges against the government in the matter of the sinking itself or the motives for authorizing it. His accusations are aimed at the subsequent cover-up. This started from Mr Nott’s statement to the House of Commons on May 4 which contained three major errors of fact, when correct information had been available for thirty-six hours. False or misleading statements were included in the White Paper and the Official Dispatch which were published in December 1982, while various prevaricating answers were given in Parliament to the tireless Dalyell. Ponting gives a summary of six falsehoods that were several times repeated about the position and course of the Belgrano when it was sunk, the time of the order to attack it, and other matters. By March 1984, the Government was under increasing political pressure about its story, and Ponting, as a senior official at the Ministry of Defence, was asked to write a paper giving a detailed chronology of the events leading to the attack: this was the paper that came to be called “The Crown Jewels”.
Ponting gives a very interesting account of some ministerial discussions about what should be done with this material. Heseltine was at first in favour of giving more information, but backed away from this, and in fact admitted to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee on November 7, 1984, that his objection to telling some of the truth had been that he might have to tell more of it. Evasions continued, in reply to letters from Dalyell and from Denzil Davies, in answer to Parliamentary questions, and in preparing answers for the Select Committee. In all this, there was one Minister who, according to Ponting, always recommended as strongly as he could that they should tell a simple lie, that all the relevant information was classified: this was John Stanley, who is still, as he was then, a junior Defence Minister. It was when the Select Committee had been deceived that Ponting blew the whistle, revealed the relevant facts to Dalyell and was eventually prosecuted under Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act.
The questions of principle raised by Ponting’s account are closely connected with that very bad law. Section 2 of it is concerned with what is called “the unauthorised communication of official information by a Crown servant”. “Official information” means any information (secret or not) that a government servant acquires in the way of duty: it thus means virtually anything. An “unauthorised communication” is said to be a communication to someone other than a person to whom the public servant is authorized to communicate it, or to whom it is in the interests of the state that he or she should communicate it. Ponting’s case is not only the most recent and one of the most dramatic cases brought under this section; it also elicited from the judge, Mr Justice McCowan, an interpretation of this provision which managed to shock even The Times and which, with any luck, will help in the long run to bring it about that the Act, already discredited, will be seen to be indefensible and will be repealed, as the Franks Committee indeed recommended in 1972 that it should be. What McCowan was reported as saying was that the policies of the State had to be understood as the policies of the government in power. As an interpretation of the Act, this is in fact very peculiar, since the Act refers not to the policies of the State, but to its interests. Even McCowan, presumably, if he thought about it, would find it hard to claim that the interests of the State were identical with those of the party in power, so it is actually obscure what he thought he was saying, except that Ponting should be convicted, a proposal which the jury laudably resisted.
It is not a good idea to have an Act—any Act, but particularly one covering matters so closely connected with the public interest—that has such vague and threatening scope. It is also not a good idea to have judges who do not care, or who are unable to think, what the principles underlying such a law might reasonably be; and one of several important lessons of Ponting’s case is that we have good reason to distrust a legal culture which does not train judges to reflect in any coherent way about the point and the limits of the law.
We certainly need new provisions to secure freedom of information, and another important lesson of this case is not merely that this is so, but that a standard line of argument used against such proposals is worthless. Ponting quotes Mrs Thatcher, who in 1984 argued against the Freedom of Information Campaign with the usual claim that freedom of information would diminish Parliament and reduce Ministers’ answerability to it.
As a reply to the issues raised by this case and by the Belgrano affair, this entirely misses the point. It was only because Ministers had been misleading Parliament—individual Members and a Select Committee alike—and intended to go on doing so, that Ponting acted as he did. Perhaps there was a time when conventions of ministerial behaviour were strong enough to make it safe to rely on the pressures that Parliament can apply. If there was such a time, it was those conventions, and not just Parliament, that were protecting us; in any case, if there was such a time, it has gone. In this respect, as in others, we have to recognize that the tacit understandings which used to make Britain a relatively liberal country have lost their power, and we must develop a more explicit style of political culture, based on new institutions to guarantee stated and enforceable rights.
Any legislation designed to increase the information available in society, and make us less liable than Britain notably is to deceit and mystification, has to be based on careful thought about the point of our having access to various kinds of information. There is no general “right to know”, in the sense that if you would merely like to know a certain thing, then people, unless there are very special reasons, are obliged to let you know it. The mere fact that members of the public are interested in certain information, or a journalist thinks that they will be, does not give them, or him, a right to that information. What is true is that there are vital interests, individual and collective, that can be safeguarded only granted access to relevant information.
The actions and policies of government are not the only areas in which our vital interests require knowledge to be available. Judith Cook’s crisp and densely informed book, The Price of Freedom, which offers a forceful argument as well as a compelling collection of horror stories about the British reliance on secrecy, touches a number of such areas, including nuclear power policy and medical research.2 She also discusses the different kind of case in which an individual has a special right to know certain information because that information is about him or her. But the business of government must be a special case, because it affects so many vital interests, and because of what democracy is supposed to be. Granted certain obvious exceptions, of which the genuine concerns of national security are indeed one, the assumption should be that what government is up to is in all senses the public’s business.
We urgently need institutions to put that assumption into practice. I am not saying that the Ford Falcons, or their British equivalent, are an imminent threat; it is a mistake, the same old British mistake, to think that it is only in those circumstances that they are necessary. We need them also to provide some protection against prejudiced, lazy and poorly argued decisions, which at the moment are hidden within the circular wall of Whitehall’s typical assumption that since the administration knows more than other people, interventions by those people can only be poorly informed and useless, so there is no point in giving out more information.
Freedom of information has a lot to do with avoiding oppressive government, corruption and complacent inefficiency, but it is not simply to be seen as a means. It is more intimately involved than that in the proper relations between government and people in a democratic and liberal state. Suppression of public information not only may lead to tyranny—in its own way, it is tyranny. The friends of liberty in Argentina understand that, and we should do so as well.

Taking Sides: The Education of a Militant Mind, by Michael Harrington
Michael Harrington started in literature. As he says in the introduction to this collection of his essays, his mentor was T. S. Eliot, “a self-proclaimed monarchist and classicist.”1 But he came to be a liberal journalist, a theorist of democratic Socialism, and, above all, a political activist, and this book, collected from the writings of more than 30 years, consists for the most part of reports from the front, bearing the occasional reactions, self-accusations and justifications of someone who has constantly sought to explain himself, his changing commitments and alliances, to himself and to the world.
There are not only reports, but reflections. The book, divided by subject as well as by time, sets out his thoughts on a range of things from the politics of the Peace Movement to the political novel and the lessons that Disney World has for Socialists (a splendid piece). Some of the material comes from a long way away, or will now seem so to those younger or from a different place. Just occasionally the controversies of the day before yesterday become inaudible under coverings of discretion: “For Mr. F., C. H., and others, there is a counterposition between political freedom and economic and social freedom. As Mr. F. writes … ”
Sometimes Mr. Harrington writes in his own defense, but self-justification is by no means the prevailing tone. He has written a new introduction to each section, which gives his sometimes rueful assessment of his essays and of the situations to which they responded. He writes with more realism than some old campaigners ever achieve, and with a commendable honesty: “I was, after all, a young and enthusiastic man under the spell of a soaring theory and that often leads to overarching generalizations that do not exactly hold up. So even though I find much of what I said valuable and true, my prediction was simply wrong.”
He honestly brings out his conflicts of the 1960’s, when an admiration and sympathy for student radicals was at the same time checked by a sharp dislike of what he calls “youthful middle-class petulance and self-indulgence.” There are a few false notes in all this, some hollow heroics and also moments of self-abasement; but from these fraught documents, crumpled papers from a time of deep conflict and a personal breakdown that occurred in 1965, he comes out as having sturdily declined to join those of the older left who immolated themselves in guilt and envy at the greening of America. He reminded impatient middle-class radical grandees of the interests of working people; insisted that the aim of protesting the Vietnam War was to stop it; and at the same time held the corner for democratic legalism and the First Amendment, partly for the very sound reason that the suppression of speech is agreeable to the right, and there are more of them.
Mr. Harrington calls himself a “social democrat.” His democracy—in the sense of protected rights, not of mere populism—is impeccable. Dissociating himself from the illiberal enthusiasms of some young radicals, as he also does when attacking the Stalinists, he was concerned not to let himself become a professional anti-Communist. Giving the American Committee for Cultural Freedom a working-over in 1955, he shrewdly remarks: “The kind of anti-Stalinism which follows from supporting the Smith Act [to outlaw the Communist Party], or even from supporting it with numerous qualifications as Sidney Hook does, is fundamentally different from that which follows from condemning the Smith Act.”
What about the social, or Socialist, part of his social democracy? The organization with which he has been associated is called “Dee-Sock,” the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee. He engagingly describes it as being on the “Left wing of the possible.” Its aim is to take Socialism from the margin of American society, to help Socialist ideas contribute in the next move to the left in American society, which he predicts will occur some time between 1986 and 1992.
In Britain, we have a political party called the Social Democratic Party. It split off originally from the Labor Party and now runs in an electoral alliance with the Liberal Party (which is not exclusively liberal in an American sense). A few of Britain’s Social Democrats might call themselves Socialists; most, though they entertain some radical aspirations, would probably now not do so. That title would still find its natural home in the Labor Party. Although Mr. Harrington, so far as I can see, never mentions the Labor Party, he describes his relations with various other European parties of similar outlook in a way suggesting that his sympathies would be with the central, non-Marxist traditions of the Labor Party.
But the Labor Party, both electorally and ideologically, is a declining force. It may possibly revive enough to benefit from the rejection of Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative Government, which even the most pessimistic suppose must come about one day. But it has few new ideas, and those that it does have fit together badly with its old ones. At one point Mr. Harrington identifies the aims of his Socialism, very much in the Labor Party’s terms, as the redistribution of wealth, government intervention on behalf of disadvantaged people and the extension of public ownership. In another piece, he is more cautious about the last; like his friends in European politics, he has also become more cautious about the power of public ownership in itself to increase either justice or efficiency.
In some respects he has moved away from the traditional European Socialist conceptions of centralized economic management to ideas of participation (which, in British politics, are put forward with particular enthusiasm by the Social Democrats’ allies the Liberals). He stresses the importance of workers’ control and, more generally, decentralized decision making. He even suggests that critical minorities should be provided with resources by the management to help them in criticizing management. These proposals are not very practical, and they are certainly not very economical; although Mr. Harrington, as the structure of his book shows, is good at moving on from outdated ideas, he seems to find it hard to abandon altogether the 60’s notion that the task for radicalism is to plan a society with limitless resources.
Apart from questions of cost, a prime question about the proposals for participation and workers’ control is how they are supposed to hang together with the old Socialist objectives of the redistribution of wealth and the use of government power to benefit the disadvantaged. The aim of the left is to make economic power more responsive to popular needs, more just in its distribution and effects and less subject to the vagaries of private greed. What the European left is facing is that, far from reinforcing one another, these objectives in many ways conflict. It used to be thought that public ownership was the means to all these objectives, but few except the most conservative (strongly represented in the British Labor Party) now believe that.
Many have come to see that there is no reason to expect that if power is decentralized among local or factory groups, this will generate decisions in favor of social justice on a national scale. What about regional policy, for instance, or the related problems of declining industries? Why should those few holding on to jobs in the rust belt—in the northern part of Britain, for instance, now an industrial desert—vote for anything except support of them?
Why should those in more hopeful spots want the limited resources to go in that direction? What can possibly resolve those deep conflicts of interest except very powerful central governments, which at the end of the line must be resistant to many local demands?
These are the problems of the Socialist inheritance now, and Mr. Harrington has not fully faced them. The same problems are even more obvious on the international level. There is no reason to expect that decisions democratically made on a national scale will help justice between countries or regions of the world, and when Mr. Harrington says that Socialism will provide the solution to the energy crisis and famine, his attitude must seem a monument to the triumph of hope over experience.
In 1981 a Socialist Government was elected in France. It has not been a great success, and it has been forced to abandon many of its distinctively Socialist initiatives. Mr. Harrington honestly chronicles this, and says, bravely, that he is not discouraged by it. But perhaps he should be, and by the many other circumstances that are now causing those in Europe who have their heart on the same side as Mr. Harrington to rethink anxiously their political objectives and to wonder how far in the present world they are compatible with one another.
Socialist ideas are still a significant source for a critique of social justice—perhaps more so in America than elsewhere, just because in America Socialist ideas have been so much at a discount. Mr. Harrington has certainly been a tireless champion of that critique. But he, like the rest of us, must face the fact that the picture of what it would be like for those ideas to succeed is less distinct and vivid than it once seemed.

A Matter of Principle, by Ronald Dworkin
When I took part—as it seems, many years ago—in a Committee to recommend reforms in the obscenity laws, we received evidence from an American constitutional lawyer who happened to be in England, was an expert on the subject, and agreed to come and talk to us about it. He explained the complex constraints exercised by the First Amendment to the US Constitution, which says that no law shall be made to abridge the freedom of speech. He rehearsed various devices that lawyers and legislators had used to try to get round these constraints in order to control pornography, including the argument that pornography was not, constitutionally speaking, ‘speech’. When he had gone out, one of the lawyers on our committee, Brian Simpson, said: ‘I think I should explain something to the Committee. Americans believe in rights.’
Ronald Dworkin is also an American lawyer; he is Professor of Jurisprudence at Oxford and much of the time resident in England. He assuredly believes in rights, and his first and now very well-known volume of papers has the title Taking Rights Seriously. He is, as well as a lawyer, a philosopher (in the technical or academic sense, not merely at the breakfast table), who addresses himself to questions of political and moral philosophy as well as to the nature of law. This spread of interest is well illustrated in the present collection of essays, which range from the political and moral basis of law to the ethics of reverse discrimination, questions of civil disobedience, and the rights, indeed, of free expression.1
Some of the pieces are a bit slight, constrained by the occasions that gave rise to them, but there is no reason to regret the inclusion of any of them. It would be a pity to miss the 12 pages of forensic argument (originally presented at the Metropolitan Museum) from which Dworkin concludes that a liberal state can support the arts, consistently with egalitarian principle and without either ‘paternalism’ or ‘élitism’, so long at least as it does not support one kind of aesthetic endeavour as being more excellent than another. I am hoping that, for his next act, he will show how to administer this policy.
This and other pieces rest on Dworkin’s egalitarian conception of social justice, and it is a pity that his arguments for that conception are not more strongly represented here. He has written two very substantial articles favouring equality of resources as a political ideal rather than equality of welfare. The central idea, roughly speaking, is that equality should be determined in terms of what is distributed rather than in terms of the satisfaction of wants or preferences of the recipients. He favours this not only for philosophical reasons—the measurement of welfare or utility has always been a suspect activity—but also for more than one moral reason. The appeal to utility seems often to give the wrong answer, as when those with greedy or over-fastidious tastes come out with a right to more. A basis in resources, moreover, leaves more elbow-room for the recipients’ freedom.
These articles, which have already started a controversy among economists, are for some reason not reprinted here, and these important interests are represented only by a brief piece against utilitarian supply-siders, and his review of Michael Walzer’s book Spheres of Justice, in which Dworkin rather loftily denounces a theory which in fact has more to offer on these problems of equality than he allows—in particular, by allowing more room for the historical peculiarities of a given society than Dworkin’s conceptions do. Dworkin looks to a timeless moral framework in matters of justice, and when he is talking about legal adjudication rather than political equality, and so is manifestly confronted with the special practices and institutions of a particular place, one of his major preoccupations is to explain how judgments which have to be determined by the traditions of a given body of law can nevertheless be regulated, as he supposes they should be, by the timeless moral framework.
The range of Dworkin’s interests, the connections he naturally sees between the law, politics and general ethical principles, are not a purely individual matter, though he displays very great individual brilliance, ingenuity and intellectual power in discussing them. American lawyers tend generally to be interested and involved in more than the law: or rather, the law and lawyers turn up in more places than those reserved to the law in other countries. Everyone knows of Americans’ legendary litigiousness, but besides lawyers who chase ambulances or take an action against the bus company when someone’s grandmother has had a heart attack at the sound of a horn, there are others who, for instance, virtually run corporations, playing much the same role in making American business flourish as accountants do in ruining ours.
Then there are those that change their country’s history. In 1954 the Supreme Court, deciding Brown v. Board of Education, ruled that racially-segregated schooling was unconstitutional, and thereby brought about very large changes in American society. Even those who wonder whether a constitutional court is in general the best engine of social change cannot fail to be moved by this extraordinary image of a nation under law, where a few men in black gowns can decide under the constraints of argument that an historically entrenched practice is illegal, and the power of the state is then deployed to stop it.
Dworkin does not say much here about the difficulties that are to be found in such a system, such as its sensitivity to the political and ideological composition of the Court. When he is considering the decision of particular cases, as in his discussion of the Bakke case (which raised questions of principle about reverse discrimination), he is very much aware of these political matters: but when he is thinking at a more general level, he tends to be concerned with questions of philosophy and morality rather than with political or sociological explanation. He powerfully criticises those who interpret the decisions of judges in terms of political or economic interests, and, equally, criticises those judgments that give colour to such interpretations; and he eloquently argues for an alternative and more principled account of what they should be doing. But there must be a question whether political and economic motives can be kept out of judicial decisions if judicial decisions are asked to do as much for the society as they are in the United States.
Dworkin’s views, quite appropriately, tend to start within the theory of legal adjudication, and to be generalised from there to issues of political theory. In saying how legal judgment should go, and also more generally, Dworkin appeals to a basic distinction between ‘principle’ and ‘policy’, where—roughly speaking—principle appeals to rights, and policy appeals to consequences. As Brian Barry pointed out in a sceptical review of this book in the Times Literary Supplement (25 October 1985), this choice of terms is itself a bit tendentious, since it suggests that, unless an argument is couched in terms of rights, it must fall below the level of principle and be a matter of opportunistic politics. This suggestion makes it a bit easier than it should be to agree with Dworkin that the best way of thinking in a principled way about political issues is always to think about them in terms of rights.
Because he starts from the law, and because, as I have already said, he does not display much interest in the sociology of political institutions, Dworkin does tend to assume the American model of a constitutional court as the instrument that not only guards but advances people’s rights. But even if we agree with him that judges should think in terms of rights rather than consequences, and also agree (with rather more hesitation, I hope) that thinking in terms of rights is always the best way of deciding matters of political principle, there is still room for discussion of what institutions will be best (in a given place, with a given history) for making those decisions. Are we bound to agree that the best way of getting such matters decided is to have them decided by judges? It is an important question, and for Britain a very real one. Many of us in recent years have come to think more favourably than we used to of a charter of rights, in the light of the unprincipled activities of the British executive. But we are bound to be doubtful of the consequence that large-scale issues of principle are to be decided by British judges. The most encouraging thought in that direction is that the institutions of a Supreme Court might themselves bring about an improvement in the clarity and imagination of legal and political thought on large issues.
What Dworkin wants of principled political argument is well brought out in his fair and carefully argued criticism, reprinted here, of the Report of that Committee on obscenity that I mentioned earlier. It is called, revealingly, ‘Do we have a right to pornography?’ The criticism is very detailed, but it has a central target, which Dworkin calls the ‘Williams strategy’—that of considering primarily whether laws directed against pornography are likely to curb any harm which it is the business of the law to curb. Against this strategy, which thinks in terms of consequences, Dworkin urges an argument in terms of rights.
In fact, the Report’s argument is not entirely in terms of consequences. It claims that there is a strong presumption in favour of freedom of speech and publication, a presumption which comes to much the same as a right. What the Report does try to do is to give some reasons in favour of admitting that presumption, and those reasons are partly in terms of consequences. Dworkin should not really object to this, since his own rights are not simply plucked out of the sky: he gives a schematic account of how to derive them. However, there is something odd about that derivation. Dworkin shows the value of rights by pointing out how awful the consequences of unrestrained Utilitarianism would be. Indeed they would be, but why should anyone suppose that we have to start from there? It seems more reasonable to start, as the Report tried to start in this matter of freedom of expression, by considering how human beings might lead a worthwhile life under the conditions of ignorance and conflict that they actually face.
The Report recommended banning only a limited range of pornography, and a system of restriction for the rest. The basis of that system was the offence caused by pornography to the average citizen if it is publicly displayed. Dworkin is very suspicious of this argument. However, it should be said at once, he does not reject the practical conclusion that there should be a system of regulation, and thinks that he would recommend something very similar himself. It is the reason given for it that he does not like. His reason is that people’s offence in face of the public display of pornography is likely to be ‘morally freighted’, dependent to an indeterminate extent on moral opinions; and it is unsound to restrict some people’s activities simply because some other people morally disapprove of them.
But if those two things are both true, then Dworkin seems to have landed us with a clear and nasty choice: either there should be no legislation restricting pornography (and, equally, public sexual activity and so on), or else there may be such legislation, but it should not be based on people’s objections to those things. Dworkin in fact escapes from this dilemma, because he does not think that people’s moral opinions, and the reactions freighted with those opinions, should never figure in arguments for legislation. He thinks they may come into the argument, but only if the argument is conducted in terms of rights. He introduces a ‘right of moral independence’, and argues that just because people’s reactions of offence are (to some indeterminate degree) morally freighted, there is a case for saying that their right to develop morally in their own autonomous way is infringed by the display of pornography. At the same time, of course, the right to moral development of those who want pornography will be violated by its suppression. So the scheme of regulation can be justified as a compromise between two conflicting applications of one and the same right.
I confess that I do not find this argument more convincing or more principled than that of the Report, but I shall not try to take it any further here: those with an interest in such matters should read Dworkin and see. What is more widely interesting is the style of his approach—in particular, that so much should be made to turn on a very refined discrimination of two styles of political argument. In one way, this is encouraging and reassuring, as is the power of the Supreme Court: getting it intellectually right can make a difference. On the other hand, there is something perverse in the demand to force all principled political argument into this one mould, and to ignore the wider range of conceptions that certainly have power in our political discourse. Perverse, and perhaps dangerous: if all important matters of public morality have to turn on what is effectively very refined legal reasoning, all discussion of them may be met by something to which Dworkin’s own passionate and impressive counter-arguments bear witness—the wide and deep public scepticism about legal reasoning.

The View from Nowhere, by Thomas Nagel
‘It seems to me that nothing approaching the truth has yet been said on this subject,’ Thomas Nagel says in the middle of this complex, wide-ranging and very interesting book; and he says it at the end of a chapter (on the freedom of the will) not, as some other philosophers might, at the beginning.1 The book argues in a determined way about the largest philosophical questions: the nature of reality, the possibility of knowledge, freedom, morality, the meaning of life. It offers, not answers to those questions, but a distinctive and unified approach to them. In that sense, the book is very ambitious. Yet one of its most notable features is its modesty. Nagel regards the problems he has chosen to discuss as more compelling than his own contribution to them, and he is always willing to say that he does not know the answer to a difficulty. His discussions are informed by a sense that what he is saying may be overthrown or overtaken by other views. It is a great relief from the remorselessly demonstrative tone that grips the work of analytical philosophers, including some of us who in principle know better.
The unifying theme, as Nagel puts it at the beginning, is the problem of ‘how to combine the perspective of a particular person inside the world with an objective view of that same world, the person and his viewpoint included. It is a problem that faces every creature with the impulse and the capacity to transcend its particular point of view and to conceive of the world as a whole.’ The problem comes in many different forms. One, very basic version concerns the place of experience in the world. We have perceptions, pains, feelings, and we naturally say that these are events. In our own case, we have an understanding of these events from the inside. In the case of other creatures we believe that analogous events take place, though we do not understand in the same way what they are like. In a famous article, Nagel earlier considered what it was like to be a bat: in the present book, he touches on the daunting question of how scrambled eggs taste to a cockroach. But whether we can imaginatively represent the content of the experience to ourselves, as most of us can with the smell (to humans) of vinegar, or, as in the case of the cockroach, we cannot, the problem remains of how to regard the experiences as events, standing in relation to other events, such as physical changes in the organism.
That is one of the difficulties of combining the subjective and the objective, the inside with the outside view. Nagel thinks that an objective view cannot include everything, and will always be incomplete. He also makes a claim about what is real, when he says ‘reality is not just objective reality.’ It is not clear, however, how this represents his thought. For him, objectivity does not apply, at least in any direct way, to things: it is not a way in which some (but not all) things exist. It is, rather, a style of understanding, one that tries to describe any kind of experience or thought from the outside, to include it in a wider account of things in which that experience or thought occupies no privileged position. The experience or thought is had from a certain point of view: the objective account is an account of that point of view which is not itself given from that point of view.
When Nagel says that reality is not just objective reality, he means, I think, not just that a wider account could always be given, but that there are some things an objective account can never capture: some things will have been left out within the account. Yet it is not clear what, exactly, he thinks will have been left out. Sometimes the objective account seems to be equated with a scientific account, and then the point is that some aspects of certain events, how they seem to subjects who have experiences, will not appear in such an account at all. Some things, or at least some aspects of some things, will be missing from any scientific description of the world.
But does that mean that no objective account at all could include them—which is surely what is implied by saying that reality is not just objective reality? The objective view was not originally defined as a specifically scientific view, but only as an external and inclusive view. There seems to be no reason why that has to leave out the subjective aspects of experiences. It can perfectly properly refer to ‘the way vinegar smells to Jones’ or ‘the way eggs taste to cockroaches’. Those are, of course, very unspecific descriptions of these features of reality: they might be said, still, to leave something out. But might they not be made more specific? Here Nagel’s point seems sometimes to be that, as in the second case, we have no idea how to make them more specific, though we believe that we are talking about something; sometimes—as in the first case—that we can make them more specific, but that in doing so our understanding essentially depends on taking up, in imagination, the subjective point of view in question. Those are significant points, but I do not think Nagel has made quite clear how they bear on questions about what exists or is included in reality.
As I said earlier, Nagel does not claim to solve all these problems. In fact, he may not think they can be solved; early in the book he says, ‘certain forms of perplexity—for example, about freedom, knowledge, and the meaning of life—seem to me to embody more insight than any of the supposed solutions to those problems,’ and I doubt whether he means only the solutions that have been offered so far. It is all the more important, then, for him to make clear to us the perplexity that is generated by reflection, the tension implicit in our views of the world. He is often very successful in this: he brings out well, for instance, a sense of the puzzling inaccessibility to us of whatever it is that is going on in the cat’s ‘furry little mind’, and he is good at setting out the classical tensions of scepticism, where the sane conviction that the world exists independently of our thoughts can lead rapidly to the idea that we have no reason to suppose that our conceptions of it are true—indeed, can leave us wondering what it is for any thoughts of ours to be conceptions of such a world at all. Nagel attaches himself firmly to the ‘realist’ side of this tension, and rightly resists the idealist tendencies that he identifies in much recent philosophy, which suggest in one way or another that the nature of our thought determines what the world can possibly contain. Some critics will feel that Nagel has taken this line in a heroically strong form, and has left too little space between realistic modesty—‘the world may be very different from what we take it to be’—and incurable scepticism: ‘the world may be totally different from anything we could ever take it to be.’ But the opportunity that he has left for such critics comes from the impressively strong style in which he has presented a natural and basic perplexity.
What one finds naturally perplexing, however, is not just a matter of whether one has a philosophically disposed nature. It is also a matter of what sort of philosophy one’s nature is disposed to, and there are some other cases in which a reader, open enough to being perplexed, may wonder whether some problem, which Nagel powerfully feels and has vividly expressed, is quite as deeply intractable as he suggests. There is, for instance, this problem: given various actual people—TN, BW and so on—what is it for one of those people to be me? The fact that I am BW certainly goes beyond the mere fact that there is such a person as BW, but how does it go beyond it? What more is involved? Nagel will, I think, convince anyone disposed to such thoughts that there is a problem here, but I am less sure that he will convince all of them that it is a very deep problem: or rather, that there is a further deep problem over and above the deep problem which he has presented already, that the world contains centres of consciousness. This is one point at which a more sharply technical discussion is needed, to show that the difficulties come from structural problems in understanding ourselves objectively, and do not consist merely in a soluble semantic tangle.
In one section, it is just because Nagel’s own sense of the problem is so powerful that he has not done enough to explain it to readers who may be, variously, constitutionally un-worried by it, immunised to some strains of it by previous philosophy, or else troubled by something other than its traditional form. This is the question about which Nagel said that he thought nothing satisfactory had been said, the question of free will, and his discussion of it provides what seems to me the least satisfactory part of his book. This problem looks like a paradigm of what he is concerned with—the tension between the inner perspective and the other, objective view. Here the tension lies in the relations between the inner view taken by an agent, the engaged perspective of someone forming and carrying out intentions, and, on the other hand, an outside explanatory view of that agent and his intentions. To the outside view he and they seem part (many, Nagel included, are fond of saying ‘merely part’) of a causal network that reaches outside him. This tension has seemed to many to be plain inconsistency: they think that if this causal network exists, there is no such thing as genuinely intentional action. There is, it is true, a tension, but there are good arguments to suggest that it is not an inconsistency. Rather, it comes from the fact that one cannot think in two modes at once, practically as an agent, and as the explanatory observer of those very aspects of one’s own action. These arguments may be inadequate, but Nagel should pay them more attention; this is one point where he seems to be transfixed by his problem at the expense of possible solutions to it.
The problem of free will has two parts. One part is the question just mentioned, whether there can be genuine, intentional, chosen action if the agent’s doings are located in a causal network that reaches beyond him. The second part concerns the relations of all that to certain moral notions—in particular, responsibility and blame. Do these notions make sense in the light of our understanding of people and their actions? It is important that the answer to the first question may be, reassuringly, ‘yes’, even though the second question deserves a much more sceptical answer. Our conceptions of blame may never have made much sense; they have stood up poorly to reflection based on quite ordinary unsuperstitious human observation, and do not need elaborate causal theories to make them look fairly seedy. Nagel, perhaps because he is so impressed by the analogy of these questions to his central theme, does not go far into this aspect, and this is rather odd, because in earlier writings he has himself implacably taken apart some of the assumptions implicit in common notions of moral responsibility.
In the case of free will, Nagel’s application of his central theme does not provide a very interesting pattern for his discussion, but when in the later part of the book he gets to general questions of moral philosophy, it once again does. Here the tension takes the form of a contrast between the engaged perspective of the agent, living a life and expressing his projects in action, and an impartial moral view of his life which the agent, as much as others, may take. In an earlier book, The Possibility of Altruism, Nagel was disposed to think that if someone has a reason to get rid of a pain in his foot, this is because it is, simply, a bad thing that there should be such a pain; and if this is so, then everyone else may equally have some reason to end that bad state of affairs. This pattern applies generally, so that all individual action, if rational and morally correct, is directed to embodying what is good or bad from everyone’s—or rather, no one’s—point of view. He has modified that view, and there are very interesting and detailed discussions here of the complex relations, as Nagel sees them, between particular personal interests, impersonal value, and individual action.
Nagel now fully admits a distinction between those aims of an agent that make some moral claim on others’ co-operation and those that do not. If someone is in severe pain, then that does make some claim on the concern and time of other appropriately placed people (however ambitiously or defensively ‘appropriately placed’ may be construed), but they are under no obligation at all to assist his passionate ambition to build a monument to his own god. What explains this difference? Nagel says: ‘the more a desire has as its object the quality of the subject’s experience, and the more immediate and independent of his other values it is, the more it will tend to generate impersonal … reasons’—that is to say, reasons for other people to do things. This seems to imply that a passionate and selfish hedonist, concentrated specially on the improvement of his pleasures, would have a special claim on our assistance, and I doubt whether this is what we want to conclude. More generally, I doubt whether the distinction can be fastened, as Nagel tries to fasten it, simply to differences in the structural or experiential nature of various projects that agents may have. It is likely to depend, more than he allows, on social conceptions of what counts as a basic need as opposed to a mere want or taste.
Debussy said of Maeterlinck that he had a ‘passion for the beyond’, and while Nagel’s work has no religious or manifestly mystical tinge, such a passion does touch his relations to the view from nowhere. The modesty I mentioned is not merely a personal matter: repeatedly in this book, he reminds human beings that they have a very limited grasp of the physical universe, and of the truth about values which he believes objectively to exist. This is not, like Montaigne’s, a humility grounded in permanent scepticism: he looks to unimaginable degrees of progress, notably in our moral existence. Nor is it a Platonic contempt for the human and the contingent in the face of the universal and impersonal. But a sense of the universal, an implied view of all activities from outside, does shape the argument. Nagel does not think that we can coherently achieve such a view, still less that we should stay with it, but as a limiting idea, it conditions his view of everything. That is why he can ask, for instance, whether we are all equally important or all equally unimportant. For many of us the question is not whether the truth lies with one of those options (or, as Nagel rather strangely puts it, ‘somewhere in between’), but whether those options mean anything at all, if we are not talking about our importance to each other.
The passion for the beyond, and its synoptic ambitions, make this in some ways an untypical work of contemporary philosophy. Although it is deeply and expertly involved in contemporary discussions, it aspires, in some part, to an earlier style of high philosophical reflection. But, in the spirit of its own thesis, at the same time it knows where it is. The ongoing tension between the universal and the local is also a tension within the book between abstract metaphysical argument and the vividly immediate, which occasionally displays itself: in the unforgettable story, for instance, of a spider who lived in a urinal at Princeton.

What Hope for the Humanities?
1 The Present Situation
It will be no news that Humanities departments in UK universities are suffering from lack of morale, lack of recruitment, and from the pressures exerted by cuts in the past and more, it seems, to come.
In this they do not of course differ from departments in other areas of academic and research activity, including those that one would suppose most relevant to technical and hence economic success. The recent report of the Royal Society for the Advisory Board on the Research Councils has pointed out that we spend less on basic science per head of population than the USA, France, West Germany, or, indeed, The Netherlands. This is not because we spend disproportionately much on the Humanities. It is interesting in this connection to note the following statistic: seven UK organisations are members of the European Science Foundation—the five Research Councils, the Royal Society, and the British Academy (representing the Humanities); the subscription is divided in proportion to the budgets of these organisations, and the British Academy’s share is ·48 of one per cent. Scientific research is of course a great deal more expensive than Humanities research, but certainly the Humanities have a considerable interest in conferences, and another notable statistic is that the Royal Society is able to devote fifteen times as much money to funding conferences as the British Academy can.
The point of these comparisons is, emphatically, not to suggest that funds should be diverted from the Natural Sciences to the Humanities. It has not been England’s characteristic problem that too much attention has been paid to the Natural and Applied Sciences, or that they bulk too large in the preferences of school leavers. There are two points in these comparisons. The first is that the Humanities are, along with the rest of the academic enterprise, under-funded. One effect of that is the unchanging department, which generates the long-stay boarding house effect: everyone has already said many times anything that they could possibly say in reply to anything that anyone else might say. The DES [Department of Education and Science] and the UGC [University Grants Committee] recognised this, if reluctantly, by extending to Humanities departments the system of ‘new blood’ appointments. The extent of these was small, and the scheme also confused two different problems, of recruiting new people and of developing new subjects; they are not the same problem, since the most urgent problem is often to recruit people to teach the established subjects. (As the philosopher David Wiggins put it, the scheme confused new blood and new bottles.)
The second point arising from these comparisons lies in the very small figures involved relatively to other activities. The pressures on universities, on research, and on the Humanities, are not solely matters of Government priorities and Government preferences: any Government will be faced with a shortage of resources to deal with these and many other problems. But it must be significant, when considering priorities, to think how much in these fields might be done for comparatively how little.
2 A ‘Civilised Society’
The Humanities are under-supported, and they need defending. There are several vital questions about the terms in which they should be defended. In fact, not even all academics are clear that the Humanities should be defended, except out of a spirit of collegial loyalty and the feeling that it is better for subjects to stick together when the university is under attack. Moreover, the case for the Humanities may not be too obvious when subjects more manifestly relevant to economic problems are themselves so seriously under-supported. More generally, there is a question of the Humanities’ significance in the changed intellectual social circumstances of the modern world.
One form taken by attacks on Humanities is the suggestion that the Humanities are a luxury article, and that in these hard times we cannot afford much of them. One style of defence of the Humanities says, “the Humanities are cultivated in a civilised society”. This defence is put forward for a variety of motives, many of them excellent; and what it says is also, as a matter of fact, true. The trouble is that it can be too easily associated with some views that are very bad defences, because they effectively accept the luxury status of the Humanities. These assimilate the Humanities to aspects of expensively cultivated life, to such things as select outings with a well-behaved company and an adequate aesthetic content. One might call this the ‘Harrods Leather Blotter’ view. In the coarsest versions of this outlook, the Humanities are regarded simply as a preparation for such a life. To call it the ‘Leather Blotter’ view does perhaps imply one version of it rather than another, the more conspicuous consumption version. There are more highbrow versions of the same thing, which focus less on conspicuous consumption and more on the cultivation of good taste. But any view that simply associates the Humanities with a class of high-grade luxuries or indeed the graces of life, will not do, and can very easily destroy what it is seeking to defend.
There is another defensive line, which sees itself as quite the opposite of the Leather Blotter view. This is a much more Puritan view. I shall call it—with some unfairness—but not much—‘the F. R. Leavis view’. This view does see the Humanities as a necessity, and to that extent it does better than the view of them as a luxury. But it does not manage to show that much of them are necessary, and it is pretty confused about what is supposed to be necessary to whom. Oddly enough, it has more in common with the Leather Blotter view than it supposes. Dr Leavis, himself, first of all, was not even in a position to defend all the major studies of the Humanities. His was a defence of the study of literature, and it explicitly rejected from its own orbit of interest philosophy and, implicitly, history. What, on this view, was the study of literature necessary for? It was necessary for the formation of an educated, cultivated and mature person; and it is particularly necessary for that, because it was associated with certain central and stern virtues, of sensibility, honesty and truthfulness.
If that claim is applied directly to individual people, it seems that good readers and sensitive critics will be noticeably better people than a lot of other people, and that is extremely hard to believe. But more important than that is the point that even if the claim were true, it would still say nothing about the relation of such persons to the rest of society. It is also very important that such a view cannot give any account of the significance of research in the Humanities. More generally, it is not well-designed to draw any consequences about who should be doing what in relation to the Humanities.
The fact that the Leavis view does not face such issues can be put by saying that it lacks a politics; and that is something that it shares with its apparent opposite, the Leather Blotter view. In Leavis’s own case, the lack of a politics took the extreme form of rejecting most of the modern world altogether. In this respect, it was just an example of that deepest of British neuroses, the Pandaemonium complex,1 the hatred of the Industrial Revolution. This perhaps can be represented in psychoanalytical terms as a desire to destroy one’s own child, which is fantasied as having been conceived by rape. That feature is in fact very important for the understanding of the Humanities in Britain, but I shall not take it any further here. There is a more general point that is more central to the question.
Both these views fail because they try to justify a study of the Humanities just in terms of desirable qualities of cultivated individuals. That is quite a good thing to try to do, but one can’t do it first. What has to be discussed first is the pursuit of certain subjects—the organised, funded, necessarily institutional pursuit of certain subjects, of certain kinds of knowledge.
We can, after that, ask questions about the distribution of that knowledge: what is the role of the expert, what is the value of a smattering, what indeed a smattering is—to know some of a subject, or to know something about it? In short, we can ask how many people who are never going to be experts should be taught how much of such subjects. Obviously, these are very important questions, and they are the ones that involve us directly in matters of university funding and so forth. They are questions about the politics of distribution of knowledge of the Humanities. But you can answer such questions only in the light of a more fundamental question, about the value of the Humanities as on-going subjects, an understanding of what they are and what they do.
3 Humanities and Social Understanding
In Boston, there is a rather grand and mysterious painting by Gauguin called Where do we Come From? … What are we? … Where are we Going? Everyone always has difficulty with the last question, whether they are an oracle, a politician or a business analyst. What is certain, I take it, is that there is no hope for answering the last question unless we have some ideas for answering the first two; even if we conclude that we can never answer the last question, that will only be because we have some insight into answers to the first two. The most basic justification of the Humanities as on-going subjects is that our insights into the first two questions essentially involve grasp of humane studies, in particular because the second question involves the first. Any understanding of social reality must be based in understanding its history, and you cannot read its history without insight into its cultural products and those of other times.
There are various different ways of conceptualising that necessity. Some may particularly emphasise the kind of social self-consciousness that is made possible by literacy. Others, again, may emphasise the further elaborated self-consciousness of distinctively modern societies, which are peculiarly reflective about themselves. Indeed, the question whether the modern world is different in quite fundamental respects from earlier forms of society, is itself a matter for the enquiries of the Humanities, such as history and philosophy. It is obviously not a matter only for them, but also for what are conventionally called the Social Sciences, but it certainly calls on the Humanities as well. One reason, indeed, that I personally prefer the term ‘the Humanities’ to the familiar organisational title ‘the Arts’ is that it reminds us of the connections embodied in another phrase, ‘the Human Sciences’.
It is not just a matter of philosophy and history. We have literatures of the past, and their criticism and their interpretation are not simply matters of historical recovery—or if they are matters of historical recovery, it is not simply so. What a text means, now, cannot by the merest necessities of historical change simply be a matter of what it meant then, and the commitment to understanding must be a commitment equally to reinterpretation.
4 Kinds of Knowledge?
There is a tradition that suggests that if one says, as I am saying, that history and more generally the disciplines of the Humanities play a vital role in understanding social reality—‘What we are’—this implies a very fundamental split between human and scientific knowledge: some contrast between ‘intuitive’ and ‘discursive’ understanding, between ‘empathetic’ and ‘objective’ knowledge (or in the German tradition, between Verstand and Vernunft). This may raise the question, again, whether some of the social sciences may not be on the other side of this fence from the Humanities; some, such as social anthropology, certainly will not be, but it may be thought that others will, and (more aggressively) that the Humanities may not play such a basic role as I am suggesting.
My belief is that these divisions are very importantly being overcome by developments in the Humanities and in some of the social sciences themselves. There are different styles of social investigation and understanding that can be roughly assigned to the opposite sides of these contrasts, but it is absolutely certain that we need both of them. The quantitative or, again, formal social sciences on the one hand, and humanistic, historical or hermeneutic disciplines on the other, stand in manifest need of each other. Tendencies in history, such as the history of mentalités and its relation to economic interpretations, are illustrations of this. A particularly interesting example on the other side is the formal theory of iterated games, which provably have multiple equilibria and yield no absolutely determinate ‘rational’ solution. This importantly means that in empirical applications, choice of a strategy will depend on notions of culture or shared understanding. These and similar results show, I think, that rational decision theory and similar procedures cannot solve all our problems, and that this conclusion can be shown by the methods of rational decision theory itself. Moreover, what is essential in arriving at social understandings or rational strategies in determinate social situations is an understanding of those situations that very frequently involve the kind of knowledge with which the Humanities, notably history, are concerned.
5 The Humanities and Social Criticism
It is the connection between the Humanities and social understanding that justifies the Humanities as subjects, and on-going research into them as forms of knowledge. I suggested that there was a further question, the politics of their distribution: what follows from all this for who should be taught how much of the Humanities? To answer this further question requires us, as I have said, to understand the points of these subjects themselves, but it requires some more as well. It requires some views about how such knowledge should properly be used and applied in political structures of the modern world, and that involves some connection between social understanding and the possibility of social criticism. That there should be any connection between the Humanities and social criticism may seem surprising to some, since an emphasis on the Humanities, certainly as against some of the social sciences, is conventionally often seen as itself conservative. But this perception, of the Humanities as of the social sciences, is merely convention, and at best represents a few local social facts, perhaps of the kind that feed the Leather Blotter and related views. In fact, emphasis on the study of the Humanities and their importance is in itself neither conservative nor radical. What it implies is rather something about the level of reflectiveness at which either conservative or radical opinions are held. Some people believe, of course, that if an outlook on society is reflective enough, it must be radical—and that belief itself can be held either optimistically by radicals, or pessimistically by conservatives. But any such beliefs lie further ahead. The present point is simply that the Humanities, in their heartland, should, and do, encourage reflection.
I have deliberately made no reference so far to the now archaic controversy between Lord Snow and Dr Leavis about the ‘two cultures’, in particular because it was conducted very much in terms of the cultivation of the individual. If we are to think in the terms set up by that controversy, there is perhaps one contrast that can be drawn between the formations offered by these two cultures. It is at least possible to be an absolutely outstanding and original scientist but at the same time be an unthinking conservative, while it is not possible to be an absolutely outstanding and original worker in the Humanities and be at least an unthinking conservative. (I recognise that this contrast is to some extent idealized.) The classic error of thoughtless conservatism is to forget that what is old is merely what used to be new. One form it can take is to invest the traditional with a sacred quality; another, and at the present time more destructive form, is to forget that anything has any history at all, and to suppose that the social world simply consists of a set of given objects to be manipulated by go-getting common sense. No such views are likely to survive unchanged by the enquiries of a truthful and imaginative history. These and other humane studies are unlikely to leave room, then, simply for thoughtless conservatism. It may well, of course, leave room for other kinds of conservatism. There are conservative views which very well recognise that social reality does not always mean what it superficially appears to mean, but thinks that things go better, on the whole, if that understanding is not too widely spread. Such a view rejects an aspiration which many modern societies have tried to adopt, and in varying degrees have succeeded in adopting, the aspiration that society should be so far as possible transparent in its workings, and should not depend for its operation on its citizens not understanding how it operates.
Most societies in the past, and very many today, are certainly not ‘transparent’ in this sense; in the past, at least, they have managed also to be innocent, possessing an elite or hierarchy which could be accepted fairly contentedly and in not too coercive a spirit. In the past, Britain may to some extent have been a society of this sort. But in the modern world, it is increasingly difficult to run a society which fails even to try to be transparent, and yet is at the same time innocent. While in many cultural respects modern societies may be coarser and cruder than their predecessors, in their understanding of large-scale organisations and in their distribution of information, they are at the same time vastly more sophisticated, and attempts to keep their political and social processes at a level at which they are simply taken for granted and fail to be the subject of question are likely to be increasingly unsuccessful and, therefore, increasingly more coercive.
It is in this area that one must look for an answer to the question of the politics of the distribution of the Humanities. If it is right that the Humanities as subjects make an essential contribution to the understanding of society and that the understanding of society is essentially connected to ways in which we can reflect on it, question it, and hence try to change it: then questions of who should be taught how much of the Humanities are essentially connected with questions of how open or transparent society should seek to be. If an elite were to run society in a relatively unquestioned way, then only an elite would need to have much insight into what it is and where it has come from. But if we believe that in the modern world, at least, that cannot indefinitely work, then the conclusion is not only that it is vital that the Humanities should be pursued as on-going subjects but that access to them, and some kind of knowledge of them, are things that should be as widely spread as they can be.
Conclusion
In the temper of the present times, and in the short term, this may seem a slightly quixotic way to defend the Humanities. To associate them, as I have done, with certain areas of the social sciences, and also with possibilities of social criticism, may seem counter-productive at a time when neither of these things is perhaps outstandingly popular in this country. It may seem safer simply to stick to some version of the Leather Blotter view, and to associate the Humanities with objects of cultivated consumption. In the present dust storm, it may seem safer to shelter downwind from the extension to the Royal Opera House. But this would be a short-sighted policy. The Humanities are concerned with a truthful understanding of what we are and where we have come from, and they, above all, demand a truthful understanding of themselves, and hence a truthful justification of their value. Moreover, society itself and those who are trying to run it also need those understandings. For it is only those understandings that can issue in reasoned demands for change, and the alternative to reasoned change is, as always, not no change, but unreasoned change, which will destroy not only the Humanities but the society that forgets about them.

The Society of Mind, by Marvin Minsky
Psychologists make models of the mind in order to explain what we say and do. Some particularly want to explain our abilities: how do we build a tower from toy blocks, or recognize a goldfinch? How do we manage to get across a room without hitting the furniture? Like many naive questions that lead to science, these do not have a meaning that is entirely fixed before people start to answer them. The questions seem, rather vaguely, in place when we reflect that we must learn to do these various things, that characteristic mistakes are made in trying to do them, and that our abilities to do them can be impaired through illness, injury, or age.
Yet at the outset, it is not very clear what you are asking when you ask exactly how we do such things: Is there a way in which you pick up a brick? The models of the mind that are designed to answer such questions also help to set them up, by defining what a “way” of doing something will be. They provide a topography of the mind’s functions, according to which our skills in perception, movement, or thought can be analyzed. We shall have come to understand how we do one of these familiar tasks when we see what must go on within the mind, so described, if we are to do it.
That bland and general description, however, conceals a difficulty—one large enough to make some people think that no explanation in such terms could ultimately succeed. How are we to describe what goes on in the mind? If we say that elements in the mind are able to do various relevant things—that one element recognizes a brick, for instance, and another sends the arm off to reach for it—we have only moved the problem back, from a familiar agent (the person) to a less familiar agent, the departmental chief in the mind. We shall have fallen into the homunculus fallacy, the old mistake of explaining a person’s actions in terms of actions by another (perhaps more specialized) person inside him.
If the aim is to provide a model by which all basic psychological skills can be explained, there is only one way out of this difficulty: the analysis must be carried to a level at which the mental elements themselves have no psychological capacities at all. Each of these ultimate mental items must be the kind of agent that simply, when it receives an input, sends off some output, which typically triggers other elements. The model-builder, aiming to display the structure of the mind of an agent who does have psychological abilities, will construct hierarchies and systems of such elements, specialized in the information that can affect them and in the changes that they can initiate.
It is a system of this kind that Marvin Minsky discusses in his book—or, rather, the possibility of such a system, or speculations around that possibility, since the book is ruminative and discursive, presents no detailed theory, and is not tied down to technicalities.1 It is large in format, and full of simple diagrams, and every section is presented on a separate page. It is the model-builder’s thought-book, designed to encourage you to wander around in it and go off in interesting directions. I think that Minsky conceives of it as rather like a mental model itself, an application of its own theory. Its reader is in somewhat the situation of the explorer in a recent Doonesbury strip, clambering around inside Reagan’s brain; and as that adventure itself suggests, he or she will find much of it fairly easy going.
Minsky’s model involves numerous “agents” organized hierarchically into “agencies.” An agent is merely a switch that turns on something else when it itself is turned on, and an agency is an organized set of switches. They are linked by complex lines of communication, called “K-lines,” which are set up and modified by what happens to the system (by experience, as one might say). The organization of the agencies is explicitly bureaucratic, and this is one of two analogies that helps to guide this model of the mind. It is a very old analogy, that of the Leviathan. The organization of agencies is the “Society” of the book’s title, but the society in question is conceived not as a political community, but as a rigidly stratified corporation. The other analogy that guides the model is that of a computer, an information-processing device, and here the similarity is thought to go beyond an analogy: the mind, for Minsky, is such a device, and the project of discovering its architecture constitutes a well-known research program, that of psychology as cognitive science.
This is closely related to the subject called “Artificial Intelligence” of which Minsky has been for many years a leader, having set up in 1959, with John McCarthy, the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT. “Cognitive science” is now the usual name for the subject that tries to explain human psychological capacities in these terms; “artificial intelligence” particularly emphasizes the project of simulating thought processes, which is not necessarily at the heart of the matter. Although computer programs controlling robot devices have played a big part in the development of cognitive science, that science is not committed to thinking that one could simulate much of what a human being can do on the kinds of computer we are familiar with. Minsky freely admits that the brain does not work like such machines, and that moreover we know little of how it does work. The models of various agencies with their linking connections are not meant to relate directly to structures in the brain but rather suggest the structure of the work the brain does. It could perhaps be misleading that some of the diagrams, with their interweaving cords, look rather as though they were intended as neurology.
The idea of cognitive science is that the description of the mind should correspond not to a wiring diagram but to a computer program. In the case of a machine, it is not hard to identify the program, since someone wrote it (or, in some cases, wrote another program that wrote it). In the case of human beings and other animals, however, the Divine Hacker who wrote the system has provided no manual to it, and we have to discover the program by scientific inquiry. That inquiry is constrained by what we know or believe about the nervous system, but within those constraints, there is a vast range of possibilities for what such a program might be. Granted there is no manual or directly identifiable software, what counts as the mind’s actual program? What does it mean to say that a given structure is in fact part of it? Presumably it means that a theory including that structure provides the best fit to the psychological data, such as the mistakes that people typically make, and also fits our understanding of evolutionary history. Thus it is a plus for a particular theory of vision expressed in these terms (derived from the work of the late David Marr) that it helps us to grasp how our visual system can be an elaborate descendant of more primitive visual systems.
Some who criticize the research program of cognitive science think that they can show that in principle it could not work. Some suggest that if it escapes the homunculus fallacy, it will merely land on the other horn of a dilemma: how could an arrangement of elements that do not understand anything issue in a system (as Minsky puts it, a society) that does understand something?2 This Catch-22 style of argument is too quick to be convincing, and like some other arguments in the history of philosophy designed to show that a particular scientific advance is impossible, can be accused of begging the question: what is at issue in this research, in part, is precisely whether intelligent systems can be compounded of unintelligent parts.
Other critics are merely empirical and skeptical, and say that there is no reason to think that a program of this kind must work, and that the rate of progress achieved after a great deal of labor provides not much reason to think that it is going to do so. This is a weighty objection, and what has been achieved is disappointing, particularly when measured against the large promises still made by some of the apologists of artificial intelligence. In this book, Minsky does not do much to reassure the skeptics, but I do not think that he is trying to. Except in passing, he does not report results, nor does he set out to justify the entire enterprise. He merely sets out various ideas and models, and invites us to consider what might be done with them.
Two authorities quoted on the back of the jacket refer to the “theory” of the mind that the book offers, but I do not see any such theory. A theory would have actually to explain something, and to explain anything, especially in this kind of field, involves explaining a lot. As Noam Chomsky has always emphasized in linguistics, it is not hard to think up some model or principle that will fit a few cases—the difficulties break out when it is confronted with a wider range of phenomena. To get to a point at which anything was actually explained, and there was really an effective theory, the notions sketched in this book would have to be given a demanding application. It may be that existing work in cognitive science has succeeded, to some extent, in giving them such an application, but if so, it is not displayed here, and Minsky, as I read him, does not suppose that it is. His aim is rather to get the reader used to the notions.
Minsky introduces a good many new technical terms, but (despite his dismissing old terms as vague or being attached to discredited theories) the new terms are sometimes just ways of labeling well-tried conceptions. A “polyneme,” for instance, is an old friend from empiricist philosophy, the complex idea (without the demand, made by some empiricist philosophers, that it should present itself as an image). Just as a word was supposed, by that old philosophy, to have its meaning in virtue of a complex idea compounded of simple ideas, so exactly the polyneme associated with the word “apple” “sets your agencies for color, shape, and size into unrelated states that represent the independent properties of being red, round, and ‘apple-sized.’ ” (The word should strictly speaking be “polymneme,” since its suffix is said to indicate a connection with memory; it is not clear whether etymology has been overridden or overlooked.)
Polynemes are connected, indirectly, to items in the mind Minsky calls frames, which are, effectively, sentence-forms. A frame embodies the structure of a certain kind of situation. A kind of frame that Minsky finds particularly important is the “Trans-frame,” which relates two items by some kind of trans-action, as when one causes another, or information is passed from one to another, or a spatial movement occurs. Thus there are “travel-frames,” containing blanks or “pronomes” for each of a number of elements including Actor-Origin-Trajectory-Destination-Vehicle. A particular value of such a frame would be a sentence such as “Jack drove from Boston to New York on the turnpike with Mary.” When you think of this sentence, and you think of the destination of the trip, you think of New York, and this is because
the polyneme for New York is attached to an AND-agent with two inputs; one of them represents the arousal of the travel-frame itself, and the other represents the arousal of the Destination pronome.
In these connections, Minsky emphasizes the role of “stereotypes” or “default assumptions.” A frame embodies a standardized situation. Given the sentence about Jack’s travel, we assume, unless there is an indication to the contrary, that it was a car that he drove, that the car had no more than four wheels, that Mary was with him in it rather than in another car, and so on. There can be little doubt that a structure of stereotypes or presumptions does underlie our linguistic and other capacities, and to this extent the view that Minsky uses is shared by much contemporary philosophy of mind and language.
Just as there are traditional elements in the account, however, so there are traditional problems, which Minsky seems not to recognize. One problem concerns “frames,” and the ways in which they are linked to language. It is easy to postulate a frame corresponding to a sentence about travel, with appropriate “pronomes”: it is simply read off from the structure of an English sentence. But what is the psychological status of this frame? Do we come to acquire it because we have been exposed to English sentences, and have in effect abstracted it from them? How could we do that unless we already understood them? And how could we understand them, at least on Minsky’s account of the matter, unless we already possessed the frame?
If we are to get out of this circle, it looks as though we must suppose that there is an innate structure, a basic architecture of the mind, that is brought into action by learning a given language and by other kinds of experience. But then it is surely quite naive to suppose that this structure should stand in simple correspondence to the surface structure of English sentences. Minsky himself makes the point that a small child can easily acquire any human language. (He also offers the very ingenious, if not quite convincing, hypothesis that this ability decays before the time of puberty—as indeed it does—in order that parents should not acquire imperfect speech habits from their children.) Real work in comparative linguistics is needed if we are to know what structures of the mind underlie this ability. The point is not that, in absence of such work, Minsky’s models provide too narrow an explanation of understanding, one that may need generalization in the light of other languages. Rather, without such work there is no psychological explanation at all—for all we know Minsky may merely be rewriting English in psychologese.
Minsky well brings out the enormous complexity of simple tasks, such as picking something up or putting one thing on another. We certainly know, in part from the hard and often disappointing work of AI investigators, that whatever processes underlie the capacities to do such things, they are very subtle and complex. But having started off admirably by making us look again at what we take for granted, he is disposed to move to another thought, that what we regularly think of as deep or difficult is merely complicated, and probably no more complicated than what we ordinarily think of as simple.
This step has rather less admirable results. It rests on the assumption that all complexity, cultural or personal, is of the same type, and this assumption leads Minsky to occasional outbreaks of reductivism, particularly near the beginning of the book, that are always unnecessary and sometimes astonishing. Thus he writes that “Selves” are not, as some “ordinary views” are alleged to hold, “magic, self-indulgent luxuries that enable our minds to break the bonds of natural cause and law. Instead, those Selves are practical necessities.” Their function is to enable us to carry out our plans. Without Selves, “we’d never get much done because we could never depend on ourselves”; as he also puts it, “One function of the Self is to keep us from changing too rapidly.” Too rapidly for whom? How can there be plans for the future to worry about, without already a self that has a future and whose plans they are.
In supposing that “we” can adopt ingenious schemes to bring ourselves into existence, as also when he tries to answer the baffling question, “How do we control our minds?” Minsky seems to have been driven to absurdity by a desire to represent the noninstrumental as instrumental. This emphasis does not necessarily follow from taking cognitive science seriously as a research program; but I think that it is a very natural result of exaggerating what it might achieve. Because it basically tries to find out how we do things, it naturally represents what we do in terms of problems and tasks, success and failure, and this, of course, presupposes that we have ends in view. With many of our activities, such as picking up a brick, the end is obvious, and at the same time the question of how, as Minsky emphasizes, is not trivial. But when we get away from these immediate or obvious kinds of ends, it may be less easy to see our projects or concerns in the light of problem-solving, and so less rewarding to try to apply the cognitive science repertoire, at this level, to what we do and experience.
One aspect of our activities to which this obviously applies is what is called “creativity.” Minsky, like other writers in these subjects, discusses this as a matter of problem-solving, considering such things as programs that “try out” strategies that may have been, in part, randomly generated. Such strategies may do for chess; but for most creativity in the arts and, indeed, the sciences, such an account is misconceived. To make a creative step is not simply to produce something new or unpredictable, but to produce something new that we find interesting or significant; and the fact that we do see some innovation in that light is, first of all, a cultural and not merely a psychological matter, and, inasmuch as it is a psychological matter, it is not in the first place a question of the heuristics of problem-solving.
The right conclusion from this is not that cognitive science is a dead duck, but that it should stick to trying to solve the kinds of problems it is adapted to solving, which, as it reminds us itself, are hard enough.3 When it goes beyond those problems into larger ambitions of explaining human life, it can fall into a stupid and shallow reductivism that is not essential to it. It does this because it has to look for elementary and obvious ends that are supposedly served by more complex and culturally elaborated activities. A particular, and notably ideological, version of this is that in which the “success” that is introduced by the very idea of problem-solving is identified simply with Success: career advancement, fame, and competitive victory are assumed to be the ends of human activity. There is a strain of this in Minsky’s book, minor but, when it appears, quite dramatic. “Consider,” he says, “an example from everyday life”:
I was trying to concentrate on a certain problem but was getting bored and sleepy. Then I imagined that one of my competitors, Professor Challenger, was about to solve the same problem. An angry wish to frustrate Challenger then kept me working on the problem for a while. The strange thing was, this problem was not of the sort that ever interested Challenger.
Well, there’s one strange thing. Another is that this is an example from everyday life. Yet another is that this is the example from everyday life that would first occur to one in thinking about the self’s construction of itself.
It would be wrong, however, to suggest that this represents the limits of Minsky’s view of things, or even a major part of it. His book is full of other kinds of thoughts, including numerous quotations from religious, philosophical, and literary writers, from Proust to the Buddha to what seem to be calendar mottoes. A few seem to me intolerably cute and corny; others are marvelous, and some of them come from a quite different kind of life, casting a great and revealing shadow over the book. So Dr. Johnson:
And while it shall please thee to continue me in this world, where there is much to be done and little to be known, teach me, by thy Holy Spirit, to withdraw my mind from unprofitable and dangerous enquiries, from difficulties vainly curious, and doubts impossible to be solved.
It is certainly no complaint that the quotations are a mixed bag. Going through Minsky’s book is a bit like going around his house, and he has a perfect right to put up on its walls what he finds familiar, helpful, interesting, or attractive. It is perhaps rather more disappointing that these thoughts are merely stuck on the wall. If he takes seriously some of the things he quotes, it is hard to see how he can say some of the things he says.
For another kind of reason, too, it is hard to see how he can say some of them. At various points in the book, statements turn up that should not be there, not because they are theoretically shaky or deeply misconceived, but merely because they are, in the most immediate and everyday sense, not true. Minsky says:
When Jack says, “Mary knows geometry,” this indicates to us that Jack would probably be satisfied by Mary’s answers to the questions about geometry that he would be disposed to ask.
It does not indicate this, unless we know something special about Jack, for instance, that he is Mary’s teacher: on the contrary, a centrally important occasion of Jack’s saying “she knows geometry” is that on which he might add “… but I don’t.” Again, Minsky points out that we might say, “I just heard a pin drop,” but not “I hear a pin dropping”; and he says that this is because a pin takes so short a time to drop that we cannot get the sentence out. But we could not say it even if the pin were dropping from the top of the Empire State Building. The explanation might rather be that a pin dropping makes no sound.
In both these cases, and others, we might repeat what A. E. Housman said about an evident but neglected principle of classical scholarship: “Three minutes’ thought would suffice to find this out; but thought is irksome and three minutes is a long time.” Does it matter if Minsky, economizing on time, cannot spare a second to turn up the corner of a sentence he has just written? There are circumstances in which it may help inquiry not to fuss with exactitude. But it is very doubtful that cognitive science is in those circumstances, and granted that it is struggling with the complexities of our thought about the everyday, it will do best if it listens carefully to its own words.
I think that many people will enjoy Minsky’s book. It brings in a lot of ideas and gives a suggestive sketch of a certain kind of psychological model. In addition, it has a kind of disheveled, undemanding, personal quality that contrasts amiably with the aggressive scientistic display that characterizes some of cognitive science and, still more, the philosophical propaganda for it. It is written in an easy and unintimidating manner. It is intriguingly concerned with skills of an everyday kind. But it is sometimes inattentive to everyday truths, and it cannot afford to be: no inquiry that is going to help us understand ourselves can do without that kind of truthfulness, an acute and wary sense of the ordinary.

1. The Society of Mind, by Marvin Minsky (Simon and Schuster, 1986).
2. This is one possible reading of John Searle’s well-known “Chinese Room” argument: see, for instance, Minds, Brains, and Science (Harvard University Press, 1985). On another reading, Searle’s point is simply that we cannot say that a system understands a language unless it has some way of showing that it understands what things in the world the terms of the language refer to: this is certainly true.
